review
by
Nadine
This
bar
REALLY
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
do

After
washing

your
hair
will
feel
squeaky
clean

I
thought
that
this
was
not
the
feel
I
needed
if
it
should
have
a
conditioning
effect

It
has
just
the
RIGHT
AMOUNT
of
conditioner
in
the
bar
so
that
your
hair
doesn't
feel
too
slinky

but
conditions
really
well

I
would
prefer
to
have
a
scent

but
I
understand
that
many
men
use
this
bar

so
I
understand

I
ONLY
use
Etee

The
ILovePDF
website
is
great

but
their
plugin
isn’t

I
gave
it
a
spin
as
I’d
like
the
simple
functionality

focusing
on
compressing
PDF

but
it
wouldn’t
work

Actually

it
crashed
the
site
completely

and
support
does
not
seem
to
be
monitored

I
urge
people
to
compress
their
PDF’s
manually

and
if
that
is
not
feasible

look
for
a
plugin
that
is
still
maintained
instead

Our
History
The
idea
for
NEMO
was
born
one
turbulent
night
in
2002
on
the
side
of
Mount
Washington

where
founder
Cam
Brensinger
spent
five
sleepless
hours
in
a
poorly
designed
bivy

That
night

he
realized
how
much
opportunity
there
was
for
thoughtful
design
as
part
of
the
equation
for
enjoying
adventure

Coming
down
the
mountain
the
next
day

he
resolved
to
tackle
that
challenge

Cam
founded
NEMO
Equipment
in
the
spring
of
his
senior
year
at
the
Rhode
Island
School
of
Design
and

three
days
after
graduation

opened
its
first
office
in
Nashua

New
Hampshire

The
name
NEMO
was
inspired
by
both
the
idea
of
"New
England
Mountain
Outfitters"
and
Jules
Verneâ€™s
Captain
Nemo

(New
England



A
spirit
of
adventure



Pretty
fitting

huh?)
Â«
One
of
NEMO's
earliest
airbeam-supported
tents

Cam
set
up
operations
in
a
restored
textile
mill
with
some
fellow
designers
and
engineers

where
he
worked
for
two
years
patterning
and
building
prototypes
of
his
first
proprietary
airbeam-supported
tents

In
2004

he
launched
the
brand

and
it
quickly
began
winning
awards
for
design
and
innovation

NEMO
was
the
overall
winner
of
the
ISPO
Brand
New
award
in
2005
and
its
designs
were
among
the
100
best
inventions
of
the
year
awarded
by
TIME
and
Popular
Science

These
kicked
off
a
string
of
awards
and
accolades
that
has
only
continued
since
then

Cam
working
on
a
tent
design
in
the
original
mill
space

Â»
For
two
decades

as
our
team
has
grown

we
have
actively
lived
out
the
belief
that
intelligently
designed
gear
enables
the
adventures
that
make
us
all
our
best
selves
â€”
humans
who
are
conscious

inspired

connected

and
mindful

Brensingerâ€™s
goal

to
build

That

has
supported

adventure
can

transform
that
first
step

Alexander
Gukov

42

is
safe
after
spending
nearly
a
full
seven
days
at
6200
meters
stuck
on
the
North
Ridge
of
Latok
I
(7145m)
in
Pakistan

He
was
stranded
since
July
25
when
his
partner
Sergey
Glazunov

26

fell
to
his
death
while
rappelling
with
most
of
the
gear

A
rescue
team
was
assembled
by
July
26
but
the
helicopters
were
unable
to
fly
until
July
31
(Pakistan
Standard
Time
is
approximately
12
hours
ahead
of
US
Mountain
Time)

When
the
weather
finally
cleared

Askari
Aviation
pilots
were
able
to
hover
and
get
a
longline

Gukov's

teammates
and
others
coordinate
the
rescue

and
he
sent
reports

which
Piunova
shared
with
Alpinist

Of
the
rescue

he
wrote

After
persevering
and
putting
their
lives
in
danger
for
two
consecutive
days

the
pilots
of
5th
Army
Aviation
High
Altitude
Squadron
proved
once
again
that
they
are
amongst
the
best
by
rescuing
Alex
Gukov
through
[a]
sling
operation
at
6300
meters


[where]
they
had
to
fight
strong
winds




The
formation
[of
two
Ecureuil
B3
helicopters]
took
off
from
Skardu


at
0455hours
and
arrived
at
Latok
BC
around
0530hours

They
passed
by
Jhola
Camp
to
lighten


the
helis

At
Latok
BC

the
pilots
decided
to
first
run
a
search
mission
to
identify
the
exact
location
of
Alex

The
fixed
line
was
connected
to
the
B3s
at
the
BC
(but
the
sling
was
kept
inside
the
heli)
and
the
helis
took
off
for
the
mission
at
around
0545hours

Fuel
was
taken
off
at
BC
to
lighten
the
helis
and
make
a
fuel
depot
at
the
BC
to
be
used
later
for
rescue
attempts
during
this
operation

The
Ecureuils
went
up
the
mountain
and
flew
for
around
45
minutes
at
6300
meters
before
spotting
Alex
on
a
narrow
ridge

Due
to
heavy
snowing

the
orange
tent
was
under
snow

The
plan
for
the
first
attempt
was
to
spot
Alex
and
[recon]
the
terrain
before
coming
down
to
BC
and
then
going
back
up
again
for
the
extraction
mission
with
the
right
fuel
load

However

once
Alex
was
spotted

the
B3s
had
enough
fuel
left
to
attempt
one
sling
operation

The
pilots
decided
to
go
for
it

The
pilots
of
Pakistan's
5th
Army
Aviation
High
Altitude
Squadron
who
completed
the
rescue

Mountain
RU
The
weather
was
good
but
the
strong
winds
were
constantly
creating
turbulence
for
the
B3s

It
was
difficult
free-air
hovering
with
these
strong
winds
at
that
altitude

However

for
once
Nature
was
helping
them
out

The
outside
temperature
was
-8
degrees
and
this
helped
them
free-air
hover
at
6300
meters
(according
to
their
calculations

ideally
they
needed
-10
degrees)

In
the
last
couple
of
days

the
temperature
was
much
higher

One
heli
threw
the
sling
[while]
hovering
close
to
the
ridge

The
other
B3
was
hovering
right
behind
him
giving
adjustment
instructions
about
[the]
sling
end
with
D
ring
to
the
lead
heli

Thus
the
two
B3s
worked
in
tandem

After
trying
for
15
minutes

Alex
finally
managed
to
get
hold
of
the
sling
and
connected
the
D
ring
to
his
harness

The
heli
flying
back
confirmed
the
safe
engagement
and
instructed
the
lead
heli
to
pull
off
with
Alex
attached

The
fuel
level
was
getting
critically
low
by
then

However

it
was
touch
and
go
as
Alex
had
forgotten
to
remove
his
anchor
to
the
mountain

Thus
he
found
himself
connected
to
the
sling
of
the
B3
on
one
end
and
Latok
to
the
other
as
the
mountain
refused
to
let
him
go

The
pilots
were
extremely
lucky
as
Alex's
Latok
anchor
finally
gave
away
releasing
him

The
B3s
pulled
out
and
brought
Alex
to
safety
at
the
BC
from
where
he
was
taken
directly
to
CMH
Skardu

He
is
in
a
good
strong
shape
and
doctors
at
CMH
are
taking
good
care
of
him




"All
these
efforts
over
seven
days


were
not
in
vain!"
Piunova
told
Alpinist

Gukov
and
Glazunov
had
set
off
for
a
summit
push
from
5512
meters
on
July
15
with
only
five
days
of
food

After
getting
pinned
down
by
snowy
weather
and
making
a
failed
summit
attempt
on
July
22

they
started
descending
the
ridge

A
helicopter
dropped
them
additional
supplies
on
July
25

the
same
day
that
Glazunov
fell

The
battery
on
Gukov's
Iridium
device

which
he'd
used
to
send
an
SOS
signal
after
the
accident

failed
on
July
26

cutting
off
communication

Vitya
Koval

a
member
of
Gukov's
expedition
who
was
attempting
a
different
route
on
the
mountain
when
the
accident
happened

told
Piunova
that
Gukov
said
he
was
on
the
verge
of
hallucinating
on
the
third
day
without
food

and
that
his
legs
were
frozen

buried
in
snow
because
he
didn't
have
the
strength
to
dig
them
out

Piunova
wrote
on
Mountain
RU
that
Gukov
was
"very
weak
and
talking
with
difficulty"
in
the
Skardu
hospital
but
was
doing
well
overall

She
later
told
Alpinist
that
he
was
dehydrated
and
has
some
minor
frostbite
that
likely
won't
require
amputation

Sergey
Glazunov
was
known
to
climb
with
his
brother

Eugeny

and
the
two
completed
a
climb
on
Chon-tor
in
2016
that
is
noted
in
the
2018
American
Alpine
Journal

Eugeny
was
originally
planning
to
join
the
Latok
expedition
as
well
but
he
had
to
cancel
one
week
before
his
departure

which
led
to
a
change
in
the
team's
tactics

Uploading

If

experiences
any
interruption
while
processing
your
file

you
will
be
able
to
check
the
processing
status

Your

files
will
remain
in
our
servers
just
to
give
you
enough
time
to
download
them

According
to
your
user
type

this
time
period
goes
from
1
to
2
hours

Even
so

you
can
delete
your

right
after
the

by
clicking
on
the
()
icon

Working
from
the
cloud
The

you
want
to
process
don't
need
to
be
stored
in
the
same
device
you
are
working
from

This
means
that
if
you
have
a
Google

you
can
download
your
files
directly

your

have
been
processed

you
can
save
them
back
to
your
cloud-based
accounts

Our
All-Purpose
Cleaner
gently
removes

Use

It
performs
just

as
the
leading
all-purpose
cleaners
-
using
lab-tested
chemistry
-
but
without
the
Plastic
(and

chemicals)

Plastic
consumption
has
skyrocketed
in
the
last
10
months

let's
be
leaders
by
showing
that
it's
possible
to
stay
clean
AND

Each

review
by
Natasha
Well
packaged

no
leaks
or
spills

Very
thick
until
dilution

Maybe
leaves
a
slight
residue

likely
not
made
for
glass

windows

stainless

but
I
wouldn't
recommend
if
that
is
what
you
are
intending
to
clean

Very
happy
with
this
product!
Very
easy
to
refill
my
bottle
and
mess
free

I
have
tried
other
tablet
refills
but
always
found
they
didn't
properly
clean

This
cleaner
is
by
far
the
best!
Will
be
reordering
again!

Alpine
Climbing
Skills
in
the
Canadian
Rockies
The
only
way
to
get
comfortable
in
the
mountains
is
to
spend
time
in
the
mountains

Crevasses

glaciers

and
avalanches
are
just
some
of
the
dangers
and
complexities
that
alpinists
have
to
overcome
on
their
dicey
endeavors

To
reach
the
summit—and
more
importantly

to
get
back
alive—you
need
an
arsenal
of
skills
only
gained
through
practice

Canada’s
Rocky
Mountains
are
an
alpinist’s
icy
dreamworld—with
Banff
and
Jasper
National
Parks
at
the
heart

Combining
an
enviable
topography
of
objectives

glaciated
terrain

and
accessibility

these
serrated
peaks
are
the
perfect
training
ground
both
for
beginners
and
highly
accomplished
alpinists

Ready
to
take
the
first
step
towards
becoming
a
confident
alpine
climber?
The

Banff
and
Jasper’s
Rocky
Mountains
spread
across
6
764
square
miles
in
western
Alberta

Awash
in
glaciers

endless
icefields

and
thousands
of
alpine
climbs

this
is
one
of
the
premier
training
grounds
for
larger
objectives
around
the
world

The
highest
peaks
in
the
Rockies
stand
just
under
4
000m
(12
000
ft
)

with
plenty
of
mountaineering
routes
around
3
000m

Because
of
their
moderate
elevation

transitional
terrain

and
low-angle

they
are

The
finest
collection
of
true
alpine
climbs
While
the
Canadian
Rockies
are
not
as
tall
as
the
Alps

Andes

or
even
Saint
Elias
in
the
Yukon

many
of
the
mountains
are
highly
technical
and
remain
test
pieces
for
some
of
the
world’s
best
alpinists

This
course
begins
at
the
Columbia
Icefields

the
largest
mass
of
glacial
ice
in
the
Canadian
Rockies

The
complex
and
fragile
alpine
environment
features
some
of
the
finest
snow
and
ice
climbing
routes
in
the
world

Learn
how
to
properly
build
anchors

rappel
on
snow

and
use
ice
axes

During
the
next
three
days

you’ll
practice
on
Mt

Athabasca

a
staggering
yet
accessible
11
000
foot
peak

Its
standard
face
features
glacier
travel
and
moderately
angled
snow
slopes

making
it
a
well-matched
challenge
for
your
first
alpine
climb

After
the
ascent

head
78
miles
south
to
Lake
Louise
for
a
comprehensive
review
of
rock
climbing

You’ll
test
and
expand
your
technical
skillset
on
some
of
the
best
protected

moderate
grade

routes
in
Canada

Who
is
this
course
for?
To
make
the
most
of
this
course

you
should
have
a
good
level
of
endurance

an
aptitude
for
rock
climbing

and
some
scrambling
experience

This
course
offers
6
days
of
training
and
climbing
and
has
been
carefully
designed
to
develop
your
existing
skills

as
well
as
teach
you
new
techniques
crucial
for
exploring
the
mountains
safely
and
independently

Start
your
journey
off
on
non-committing
terrain
and
progress
to
steeper
rock
faces
and
glaciated
areas

Once
you
have
mastered
the
basics
of
this
course

climbs
such
as
Mt

Assiniboine

East
Ridge
of
Mt

Temple

or
Mt

Robson
should
be
within
your
abilities

To
continue
honing
your
skills
on
larger
objectives

consider
Aconcagua

Matterhorn

Mont
Blanc

and
even
Denali

for
a
step
up
in
skill
development
and
difficulty

While
most
of
these
don’t
require
advanced
abilities

they
require
a
depth
of
knowledge
and
skills
covered
by
this
course

What
will
you
learn
in
this
course?
Some
lessons
are
obvious

others
less
so

Hands-on
mentorship
from
a
professional
Mountain
Guide
is
the
most
effective
way
to
build
a
strong
foundation

Skills
will
be
explained

demonstrated
in
the
field

and
then
put
into
practice
during
glacier
crossings
and
ascents

PLANNING


NAVIGATING
One
key
to
a
successful
adventure
is
route
finding
and
a
sense
of
orientation

Navigation
in
challenging
terrain

especially
during
whiteouts

is
one
of
the
most
crucial
skills
to
master
on
your
journey
to
become
an
independent
alpinist

LEADERSHIP
Leadership
skills
are
important
for
a
safe
and
successful
endeavor

whether
you
are
with
a
guide
or
friends

Your
guide
will
help
you
develop
your
skills
by
putting
you
in
leadership
positions
during
the
course

GLACIER
TRAVEL
SKILLS
Breathtaking
glaciers
are
what
makes
alpine
climbing
so
epic

but
for
all
their
beauty—they
are
dangerous

Crevasses

seracs

rockfalls

and
whiteouts
can
be
fatal
if
not
approached
carefully

Perfecting
glacier
travel
skills
can
only
happen
by
spending
time
working
your
way
through
glaciated
terrain

Gain
confidence
under
the
watchful
eye
of
a
guide

SAFETY
AND
RESCUE
Navigating
rock
faces
across
multiple
pitches—especially
in
an
alpine
environment—involves
risky
and
dangerous
situations

Learning
proper
rescue
techniques
and
recognizing
changing
hazard
conditions
are
critical
to
safety

Prusiking
from
a
crevasse

or
hauling
someone
out
of
one

are
stressful
and
strenuous
situations

but
practice
makes
perfect!
ROCK
CLIMBING
One
of
the
main
differences
between
mountaineering
and
alpinism
is
that
alpine
climbing
involves
pitches
of
rock

ice

or
steep
snow
where
a
rope
is
needed
for
protection
from
a
fall

Upgrade
your
basic
climbing
skills
over
three
days
in
Lake
Louise

Practice
sport
and
traditional

single-pitch
and
multi-pitch
on
different
routes
in
the
area

SNOW
AND
ICE
CLIMBING
Snow
and
ice
are
ever-changing
mediums
that
make
alpine
climbing
exciting
but
precarious

Crossing
a
glacier
with
an
ice
axe
can
be
a
big
test
of
patience
and
endurance

As
glaciated
terrain
becomes
steeper
and
more
fractured

your
technical
skills
are
put
to
the
test

sometimes
requiring
the
employment
of
skills
used
to
ascend
frozen
waterfalls

Learn
how
to
work
your
way
up
near-vertical
snow
and
master
anchors

V-threads

ice
screws

T-slots

snow
pickets

and
rappelling

TOOLS
AND
EQUIPMENT
Moving
through
alpine
terrain
can
be
tricky

but
with
the
right
tools
and
proper
usage

you’ll
have
better
chances
of
reaching
your
goal

Using
ropes

anchors

ice
axes

and
crampons
requires
a
lot
of
technical
knowledge

Start
with
each
technique
on
non-committing
terrain
and
gradually
apply
it
to
steeper
slopes

ALPINE
ASCENT
Mt

Athabasca
(3
491m/11
453
ft
)
is
an
excellent
venue
for
someone’s
first
exposure
to
climbing
a
big
mountain

It
boasts
crevassed
glaciers

seracs

and
snow
and
ice
slopes
of
moderate
steepness

It
is
one
of
the
most
accessible
big
peaks
in
the
Canadian
Rockies
and
is
suitable
for
both
beginner
and
experienced
alpinists

A
lifetime
of
learning
Alpine
climbing
goes
bigger

bolder

and
higher
than
most
sports

This
fast-and-light
discipline
builds
upon
general
mountaineering
by
including
pitches
of
rock
or
ice—combining
long
days
with
technical
climbing

When
the
mountains
of
your
dreams
get
steeper
and
more
severe

so
too
do
the
risks

For
that
reason

alpinism
is
a
lifelong
process
that
can
reward
you
with
some
of
the
most
fulfilling—and
demanding—experiences
life
has
to
offer

WATCH
THE
WHOLE
STORY
IN
OUR
WEBINAR
A
rich
mountaineering
history
The
Canadian
Rockies
were
created
by
intense
geological
forces

tectonic
plates

volcanic
activity

and
cirque
glaciers
left
over
from
the
last
glacial
period
about
10
000
years
ago

These
glaciers
shaped
the
jagged

narrow
ridges
called
arêtes

wide
U-shaped
valleys

and
deep
fjords
along
the
coastline

This
rough
terrain
remained
little
explored
until
the
19th
century
when
the
Canadian
Pacific
Railway
hired
A

B

Rogers
to
survey
the
terrain
to
find
routes
through
the
range

With
the
help
of
Swiss
mountain
guides

he
found
a
way
through
the
Selkirks
in
1881

known
today
as
Rogers
Pass

A
few
years
later

Banff
was
founded
as
a
railway
tunnel
site

Follow
in
the
footsteps
of
legends
In
1906

a
few
like-minded
individuals
formed
the
Alpine
Club
of
Canada

To
upgrade
their
skills

the
club
hired
their
first
professional
mountain
guide—an
Austrian
named
Conrad
Kain

who
went
on
to
complete
more
than
60
first
ascents
around
Alberta
and
British
Columbia

including
one
of
Canada’s
most
famous

the
Kain
Route
on
Bugaboo
Spire

These
early
explorations
sparked
major
interest
for
mountaineering
in
the
country
that
continues
to
this
day

Your
guide
When
he
first
stepped
foot
in
the
mountains

Jeff
Bullock
knew
this
was
home

He’s
been
wondering
what
adventures
the
snow-capped
peaks
have
had
in
store
since
he
was
12

Jeff
started
training
for
his
ACMG/IFMGA
mountain
guide
certificate
in
2002
and
started
his
own
business

Alpine
Air
Adventures

To
this
day

he
has
yet
to
find
a
better
feeling
than
sharing
his
passion
for
adventure
you
can
only
find
high
up
in
the
alpine
kingdom
of
the
Canadian
Rockies

Another
great
couple
trips
with
Jeff
(both
multi-day
mountaineering
and
a
rock
climbing
outings)

As
always
he’s
a
great
guide
that’s
fun
to
spend
time
with
and
climb
with
safely

What
if
Iâ€™ve
never
alpine
climbed
before?
No
alpine
climbing
experience
is
necessary
to
join
this
course

However

you
need
to
be
in
excellent
aerobic
condition
and
have
previous
experience
with
either
mountaineering
or
scrambling

This
means
you
have
ascended
lower-angle
non-technical
climbs
where
you
can
walk
up
the
majority
of
a
mountaineering
objective

How
fit
do
I
need
to
be?
The
pursuit
of
alpine
climbing
requires
more
skills
than
mountaineering

has
a
larger
psychological
component

and
takes
longer
to
master

The
standard
routes

in
good
condition

are
suitable
for
beginner
mountaineers

You
need
to
be
in
excellent
aerobic
condition
and
have
previous
experience
with
advanced
hiking
or
mountaineering

Even
though
alpine
climbing
is
all
about
using
good
movement
techniques
and
tools

rather
than
muscling
up
a
cliff
using
brute
strength

a
week
in
the
alpine
environment
will
test
you

Be
prepared
for
full
days
of
strenuous
climbing
in
cold
temperatures
and
changeable
weather
conditions
Â
Be
honest
with
yourself
about
your
experience
and
fitness

You
will
be

How
can
I
prepare
for
this
course?
The
aim
of
alpinism
is
to
be
self-sufficient

meaning
you
carry
everything
yourself

without
porters

and
to
travel
fast
and
light

Alpine
climbing
is
essentially
an
endurance
event
so
the
best
way
to
prepare
is
to
work
on
your
cardio
and
strength
levels

Youâ€™ll
use
your
major
leg
muscles
and
your
core
muscles

so
try
to
increase
endurance
in
those
same
muscle
groups
Â
Work
on
your
overall
endurance
by
uphill/downhill
hiking

scrambling
and
trail
running
under
load

Balance
and
flexibility
training
will
also
help
you
make
the
most
of
the
course
Â
Up
to
two
weeks
prior
to
the
course
Â
begin
to
gradually
wake
up
earlier

it
is
not
uncommon
to
wake
up
at
2-3
am
for
a
summit

If
you
want
to
get
a
hang
of
outdoor
rock
climbing

to
this
course

join

July

Earl
Bates
traces
stories
from
the
50-year
career
of
Werner
Braun

one
of
Yosemite's
most
reticent
Stonemasters

Braun
retired
from
his
work
in
the
Valley
last
year
and
moved
to
St

George

Utah

with
his
wife
Merry

Braun
was
among
the
best
free
soloists
of
his
generation
and
ultimately
proved
himself
to
be
a
significant
asset
to
the
Park
Service
and
Yosemite
Search
and
Rescue

but
you
won't
hear
him
say
so

In
his
typical
fashion

Braun
continues
to
shy
away
from
recognition

and
that
is
why
some
of
Yosemite's
best
stories
may
never
be
told

I
dream

it

Mike
Libecki
shared
some
stories
and
photos
with
the
#AlpinistCommunityProject
about
an
expedition
to
Greenland
in
2015
to
climb
a
remote

unclimbed
peak

which
he'd
named
the
Polar
Bear
Fang
after
finding
it
on
maps
and
reconnoitering
the
approach
by
boat
on
different
trips
through
the
years

He
had
tried
to
reach
the
Fang--which
he
is
certain
is
in
a
never-before
visited
area--on
several
occasions

but
he
had
been
shut
down
nearly
every
time
because
of
sea
ice

and
once
because
there
were
too
many
polar
bears
to
get
off
the
boat

On
this
last
attempt

he'd
planned
to
go
alone

but
that
quickly

an

the
first
ascent
of
the

Among

was
Nepali

took

in
many

never

Some

miles

tangled

Description
Your
Toothbrush


Our
Planet
Introducing
the
one


only
etee
Bamboo
Toothbrush
with
a
Replaceable
Head!
Hold
up
-
WHAT!?!
It's
true

The
paparazzi
can't
get
enough
of
these
beauties
and
they're
a
SERIOUS
hot
commodity
around
here

Each
toothbrush
consists
of
2
(fully
assembled)
parts
-
first

you've
got
your
rounded
toothbrush
handle

whose
base
is
dipped
in
water-based
paint
(the
paint
helps
to
protect
from
any
water
damage
that
you
get
at
the
base
of
other
bamboo
toothbrushes)

Added
to
that
is
the
detachable
toothbrush
head
with
100%
plant-based
bristles

The
total
length
of
the
toothbrush
is
7
5"

Hooray!
The
rounded
toothbrush
handle
is
made
of
FSC
certified
bamboo
and
the
bristles
are
made
from
castor
bean
oil

which
is
the
most
eco-friendly
alternative
on
the
market
today
-
double
hooray!
What
else
is
in
my
toothbrush?
A
metal
staple
is
used
to
clamp
the
plant-based
bristles
into
the
brush

keeping
them
from
falling
out
you're
brushing
your
chiclets!
It's
a
normal
part
of
a
toothbrush

and
even
plastic
ones
have
staples
in
them
too!
When
you're
ready
to
replace
your
toothbrush
head
(dentists
suggest
every
3
months)

simply
replace
with
a
new
head
and
keep
the
handle

To
dispose
of
the
used
head

you
can
also
remove
the
bristles
from
the
head
using
a
pair
of
pliers

which
will
also
remove
the
staple

and
compost
the
bamboo

The
bristles
are
not
yet
biodegradable

but
fear
not

we're
working
on
a
solution!

I
love
everything
about
this
toothbrush!
Itâ€™s
very
well
made
and
I
even
love
the
paint
on
the
end

I
bought
the
coral
one
and
itâ€™s
really
pretty

Iâ€™m
so
happy
with
the
soft
bristles
too

theyâ€™re
not
too
soft
so
it
still
feels
like
it
cleans
my
teeth

but
also
not
too
rough

Shipping
was
amazing

it
got
here
soooo
much
earlier
than
expected!
Also
love
that
itâ€™s
low
waste
and
itâ€™ll
be
easy
to
just
replace
the
head
rather
than
throwing
out
a
whole
toothbrush
every
few
months

Love
the
replaceable
heads

much
easier
to
change

more
accessible

and
cheaper
than
buying
a
whole
new
toothbrush
every
time

Amazing
quality
as
well!

Introduction

approaches
PR
and

Visibility
At
Purple
Orange

weâ€™ve
pioneered
a
new
practice
around
the
integration
of
earned
media
and
search
engines

We
use
earned
media
to
develop
top-of-page
brand
visibility
in
lucrative
high-competition
keywords
where
brand-owned
content
rarely
surfaces
and
PPC
is
expensive

Rather
than
developing
just
backlinks
for
our
clients

we
develop
ubiquitous
brand
placement
within
search
results
â€”
using
earned
media

rather
than
brand-owned
content
â€”
to
influence
the
modern
customer
journey
and

If
youâ€™re
reading
this

you
likely
have
experienced
the
same
troubling
trend
in
PR

top
tier
media
placements
just
donâ€™t
produce
enough
trackable
ROI

All
PR
agencies
and
clients
know
that
the
value
of
PR
is
difficult
to
measure

However

when
we
brought
home
a
top
US
media
recognition
for
a
client
(a
full
page
editorial
w/
award
in
the
largest
outdoor
publication
in
the
US)

and
only
a
dismal
amount
of
products
were
sold

we
had
to
ask
ourselves
some
hard
questions

How
does
the
modern
customer
journey
work?
And
what
is
PRâ€™s
role
in
this
newly
defined
journey?
PR
has
always
been
about
soliciting
third-party
endorsements
and
in-so-doing

accessing
the
audiences
of
those
third
parties

The
traditional
platform
to
do
this
has
been
the
publishing
industry
(magazines

newspapers

etc
)

but
over
the
past
decade
PR
has
transformed
from
an
industry
focused
on
newspaper
clippings
to
something
much
more
dynamic
that
encompasses
social
influencer

content
creation

events

and
live
streaming
video
(just
to
name
a
few)

However

the
single
most
important
way
to
syndicate
brand
messages
isnâ€™t
what
you
might
think

Consider
these
stats

81%
ofÂ
retail
shoppers
conduct
online
research
before
buying
93
percentÂ
of
online
experiences
begin
with
a
search
engine
92%
of
all
searches
(globally)
are
on
Google
The
top
5
organic
results
receive
around
70%
of
all
the
“clicks”
within
the
SERP
(Search
Engine
Results
Page)
Thatâ€™s
right

Google
Search
is
the
single
most
important
publisher
in
the
world

Which
means
Google
should
be
at
the
center
of
every
successful
PR
strategy

BioLite
Case
Study
At
the
start
of
2020

Purple
Orange
identified
and
short
listed
70
high-value
keywords
that
represented
more
than
200
000
monthly
searches

The
goal
was
to
use
PR
to
develop
first-page
brand
visibility
(reviews

product
recommendations

etc
)
among
high-value
non-branded
search
terms

Although
an
experimental
exercise

our
goal
was
to
increase
BioLiteâ€™s
â€œShare
of
Clickâ€?
across
all
the
SERPs
we
were
tracking

Share
of
Click
is
a
new
audience
measurement
methodology
that
Purple
Orange
developed
in
concert
with
the
search
engine
software
start-up
Visably

Share
of
Click
is
similar

Share

BioLite
is
a
technology
hardgoods
company
that
builds
electronics
that

people

and
store
electricity

produce
light

and
cook
while
off-grid

Target
keyword
lists
were
developed
to
focus
our
PR
efforts

We
focused
exclusively
on
informational
keywords
that
demonstrated
high
opportunity
for
earned
media
(7
or
more
earned
media
results
in
the
SERP)

We
segmented
our
keywords
by
consumer
category

focusing
on
non-branded
keyword
that
promote
product
discovery
in
the
following
key
areas
or
campaigns

Light
–
Headlamps
Light
–
Lanterns
Charge
(power
banks
+
solar
generation)
Cook
(firepit
+
camp
stoves)
We
focused
on
keywords
with
relatively
high
audience
engagement
(SERP
click-through-rate
over
60%)
and
modest
monthly
search
volume

Once
the
keyword
lists
were
established

we
thoroughly
audited
each
SERP
to
collect
the
organic
results
and
begin
to
backfill
information
in
the
form
of
a
media
list

We
collected
the
following
information
from
each
organic
result

By
repeating
this
process
across
70+
keywords

we
built
a
media
outreach
list
that
included
outlet
and
author
information
for
more
than
500
first-page
earned
media
results

We
then
used
this
information
has
the
basis
of
our
PR
outreach
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
â€”
focusing
on
building
better
relationships
with
these

We
tracked
success
by
looking
at

our

web
traffic
and
trip
sales
â€”
a
reverse
outcome
from
nearly
every
other
travel-related
brand
in
2020
Â
We
helped
57Hours
launch
their
“Epic
Adventures”
webinar
series
early
into
the
pandemic

where
viewers
could
tune
in
to
hear
firsthand
tales
from
guides
of
the
most
incredible
bucket
list
adventures–sail
to
ski
adventures
in
Norway

climbing
in
Chamonix

trekking
in
Iceland

and
kitesurfing
in
the
Caribbean…to
name
a
few

57Hours
launched
the
webinar
series
to
inspire
virtual
adventure
and
encourage
long
term
trip
planning
for
1-2
years
in
the
future

partnering
with
a
media
outlet
for
each
episode
to
help
further
its
reach

57Hours
started
receiving
over
1
000
registrations
per
episode

which
quickly
translated
into
trip
bookings

They
subsequently
invested
into
developing
their
YouTube
channel
to
showcase
the
webinar
recordings

and
the
channel
quickly
surpassed
20
000
views

The
webinar
series
gave
potential
clients
the
opportunity
to
â€œmeetâ€?
the
guides
hosting
each
episode
and
learn
about
these
once-in-a-lifetime
trips
that
many
people
didnâ€™t
even
know
existed
Â
Data-Driven
PR
Purple
Orange
also
developed
survey-based
PR
tactics

with
questionnaires
sent
to
57Hoursâ€™
network
of
independent
guides

After
analyzing
the
data
and
building
graphics
to
represent
our
findings

we
turned
to
the
media
to
place
the
results

The
first
survey
we
conducted
aimed
to
demonstrate
the
effect
of
COVID
on
the
guiding
industry

and
we
did
a
follow
up
a
year
later
to
see
how
opinions
had
changed
as
the
pandemic
continued
into
its
second
year

Another
survey
focused
on
the
prevalence
of
discriminatory
route
names
and
the
efforts
of
those
in
the
outdoor
community
who
are
spearheading
movements
to
change
these
names

57Hours
seeks
to
be
a
disruptor
in
the
adventure
travel
industry

and
these
surveys
are
just
one
example
of
how
the
company
has
become
a
thought
leader
in
the
outdoor
community

These
shifting
marketing
strategies
allowed
57Hours
to
uniquely
thrive
as
a
travel
brand
during
a
pandemic

Their
trip
bookings
increased
2-3x
from
what
they
were
pre-COVID

57Hoursâ€™
organic
site
traffic
increased
10x

with
available
trip
offerings
and
site
content
growing
on
average
20%
MoM
through
all
of
2020
and
into
2021

Purple
Orange
took
our
PR
to
another
level

making
the
57hours
brand
present
in
all
relevant
outdoor
media

and
pushing
our
company
to
new
media
channels
as
well

Abby
and
the
entire
team
tuned
into
our
specific
needs
and
were
super
fast
to
respond
to
new
directions
and
opportunities
as
the
business
grew

We
were
more
than
happy
to
extend
the
partnership
into
our
3rd
year
together

the
height
of
the

we
have
begun
re-opening
them

limited

to

early
2022

YOUR
DISH
SOAP


OUR
PLANET
Plastic-free
dish
soap?
Say
it
ain't
so!
etee's
team
of
innovators
have
created
a
natural
pod
that
holds
our
concentrated
dish
soap
so
that
you
can
wave
goodbye
to
the
plastic
dish
soap
bottles
in
the
grocery
aisle
-
see
ya
later!
Each
biodegradable
pod
holds
our
all-natural

bio-based
concentrated
dish
soap
and
is
made
with
100%
plant-based
ingredients

Free
from
SLS

Phthalates

Sulphites

Sulphates

Synthetics
Colourants
or
Fragrance

And
how
about
some
lemon
limey
citrus
magic
happening
while
you
soap
up
your
dishes



sounds
good
right?
We
partnered
up
with
local
smell
good
guru
Christine
Chanter
Botanicals
so
we
could
bring
some
sunshine
right
to
those
dirty
dishes

You
can
check
out
the
nose
behind
our
scent
on
her
website
or
find
her
on
Instagram
and
see
some
of
her
sniffy
creations!
Each
soap
pod
makes
400
ml
/
13
5
oz
of
dish
soap

These
plastic-free
pods
are
handmade
in
our
Toronto
area
shop

so
you
can
trust
that
not
only
are
our
employees
fairly
treated

they're
also
free
to
goof
it
up
from
time
to
time

We
kept
it
local
with
getting
someone
in
the
Toronto
area
to
formulate
our
dish
soap
concentrate

too!
How
to
Make
Your
Plastic-Free
Dish
Soap
Simply
fill
a
dispenser
or
jar
with
375
ml
(12
5
oz)
of
water

Rip
open
your
pod
of
concentrated
dish
soap
over
the
jar
and
squeeze
the
soap
into
the
water

Stir
the
mixture

cover
with
a
lid
or
cap
and
give
the
dispenser
a
good
shake

Let
it
sit
for
an
hour
before
first
use

Dispose
the
pod
in
the
compost
or
garbage
(rest
assured
it'll
biodegrade
in
either)

Squirt
some
soap
into
your
sink
of
water
or
onto
a
dish
cloth
and
clean
those
dishes
like
a
pro

Rinse
any
soap
from
your
dishes
using
hot
water
and
for
best
results
dry
them
with
a
clean
cloth
after
you're
done

Reviews
"Mine
arrived
in
perfect
shape

I
used
a
few
drops
on
a
wet
cloth
to
wash
off
lipstick
on
a
glass

Wiped
off
easily

What
I
loved
is
unlike
some
of
the
leading
dishsoaps
I
didn't
need
to
rinse
with
a
ton
of
water

Who
want
soap
residues
in
their
Pinot
Grigio!"
-
Diane
R
"Weâ€™ve
been
using
the
liquid
soap
now
for
a
bit
and
this
is
what
I
think

Works
REALLY
WELL

like
REALLY
well

cleans
up
all
the
buttery/oily
messes
weâ€™ve
had
so
far
without
leaving
any
greasy
residue

bubbles
up
nicely
with
the
Swedish
dish
cloth/
luffa
sponge
(Also

I
LOVE
THIS
SPONGE
ITS
AWESOME!!)

Dispenses
out
of
the
spout
well
and
doesnâ€™t
clog
it
up
the
way
I
was
worried
it
would


"
-
ï»¿Annie
B
"I've
gotten
to
use
the
soap
and
scrubby
a
few
times
now

I
used
to
fill
my
sink
with
water
and
squirt
a
bunch
of
soap
in

In
an
effort
to
use
less
water

I
switched
to
a
plastic
scrubby
brush
that
you
fill
with
soap

I
found
that
the
head
needed
frequent
replacing
and
that
I
wasted
a
lot
of
soap
which
leaked
out
between
uses

The
etee
soap
has
been
a
perfect
solution

I
find
that
it
works
great
and
you
really
only
need
a
small
amount



I'm
hoping
not
to
buy
any
other
dish
soap

Update

Steve
from
Etee
reached
out
to
me
and
sent
me
a
replacement
pod
which
I
so
appreciate!
The
soap
does
work
well
and
I
hope
theyâ€™ll
keep
selling
it
and
improving
the
packaging
because
itâ€™s
such
a
great
product!
I
was
a
bit
bummed
when
they
arrived
because
they
had
leaked
and
then
one
of
them
entirely
leaked
out
in
my
cabinet
before
I
was
able
to
use
it

I
had
used
one
of
the
other
tubes
first
(they
come
in
a
set
of
3)

So
I
basically
ended
up
paying
for
3
but
only
being
able
to
use
2

I
still
think
the
beeswax
is
a
really
cool
idea

but
I
think
there
is
work
to
be
done
to
keep
them
from
leaking

These
are
sensational

and
the
new
packaging
is
great!
I
love
that
my
kitchen
is
becoming
plastic
free

YOUR
DISH
SOAP


OUR
PLANET
Plastic-free
dish
soap?
Say
it
ain't
so!
etee's
team
of
innovators
have
created
a
natural
pod
that
holds
our
concentrated
dish
soap
so
that
you
can
wave
goodbye
to
the
plastic
dish
soap
bottles
in
the
grocery
aisle
-
see
ya
later!
Each
biodegradable
pod
holds
our
all-natural

bio-based
concentrated
dish
soap
and
is
made
with
100%
plant-based
ingredients

Free
from
SLS

Phthalates

Sulphites

Sulphates

Synthetics
Colourants
or
Fragrance

And
how
about
some
lemon
limey
citrus
magic
happening
while
you
soap
up
your
dishes



sounds
good
right?
We
partnered
up
with
local
smell
good
guru
Christine
Chanter
Botanicals
so
we
could
bring
some
sunshine
right
to
those
dirty
dishes

You
can
check
out
the
nose
behind
our
scent
on
her
website
or
find
her
on
Instagram
and
see
some
of
her
sniffy
creations!
Each
soap
pod
makes
400
ml
/
13
5
oz
of
dish
soap

These
plastic-free
pods
are
handmade
in
our
Toronto
area
shop

so
you
can
trust
that
not
only
are
our
employees
fairly
treated

they're
also
free
to
goof
it
up
from
time
to
time

We
kept
it
local
with
getting
someone
in
the
Toronto
area
to
formulate
our
dish
soap
concentrate

too!
How
to
Make
Your
Plastic-Free
Dish
Soap
Simply
fill
a
dispenser
or
jar
with
375
ml
(12
5
oz)
of
water

Rip
open
your
pod
of
concentrated
dish
soap
over
the
jar
and
squeeze
the
soap
into
the
water

Stir
the
mixture

cover
with
a
lid
or
cap
and
give
the
dispenser
a
good
shake

Let
it
sit
for
an
hour
before
first
use

Dispose
the
pod
in
the
compost
or
garbage
(rest
assured
it'll
biodegrade
in

"Mine
arrived
in
perfect
shape

I
used
a
few
drops
on
a
wet
cloth
to
wash
off
lipstick
on
a
glass

Wiped
off
easily

What
I
loved
is
unlike
some
of
the
leading
dishsoaps
I
didn't
need
to
rinse
with
a
ton
of
water

Who
want
soap
residues
in
their
Pinot
Grigio!"

"Weâ€™ve
been
using
the
liquid
soap
now
for
a
bit
and
this
is
what
I
think

Works
REALLY
WELL

like
REALLY
well

cleans
up
all
the
buttery/oily
messes
weâ€™ve
had
so
far
without
leaving
any
greasy
residue

bubbles
up
nicely
with
the
Swedish
dish
cloth/
luffa
sponge
(Also

I
LOVE
THIS
SPONGE
ITS
AWESOME!!)

Dispenses
out
of
the
spout
well
and
doesnâ€™t
clog
it
up
the
way
I
was
worried
it
would

"I've
gotten
to
use
the
soap
and
scrubby
a
few
times
now

I
used
to
fill
my
sink
with
water
and
squirt
a
bunch
of
soap
in

In
an
effort
to
use
less
water

I
switched
to
a
plastic
scrubby
brush
that
you
fill
with
soap

I
found
that
the
head
needed
frequent
replacing
and
that
I
wasted
a
lot
of
soap
which
leaked
out
between
uses

The
etee
soap
has
been
a
perfect
solution

I
find
that
it
works
great
and
you
really
only
need
a
small
amount



I'm
hoping
not
to
buy
any
other
dish
soap

*sigh*
We
really

really
wanted
to
like
this
product

as
we're
trying
to
make
as
many
switches
to
more
eco-friendly
products
in
our
home
as
possible

but



it
was
just
okay

My
biggest
complaint
is
it
just
doesn't
cut
grease

My
Tupperware
and
other
plastic
containers
still
feel
slimy
after
scrubbing
them
twice

And
I
am
finding
we
have
to
use
a
LOT
of
dish
soap
to
get
one
sinkful
of
dishes
done

For
the
price

we
won't
buy
it
again

Not
my

I
bought
several

This
one
is
for
my

I
really
love

Our

is
simple

â€?
Eliminate
carbon
emissions
by
making
climate
neutrality
something
that
all
businesses
do

The
world
must
become
net-zero
by
2050

Which
means

emit
no
more
greenhouse
gases
than
our
ecosystems
can
safely
absorb

Getting
there
will
take
money
and
it
will
involve
all
of
us

At
Climate
Neutral

our
goal
is
to
get
every
company
to
spend
just
a
fraction
of
revenues
each
year
to
eliminate
carbon
emissions

Starting
now

As
a
consumer

you
can
help
by
supporting
businesses
that
take
this
step

Businesses
with
the
Climate
NeutralÂ
Certified
label

If
we
do
this
together

we'll
push
billions
of
dollars
into
projects
that
eliminate
carbon
from
the

â€œGoing

process
gave
my
team

fresh
insight
into
our

Now
we're
equipped
to
strategically
reduce
our

and
invest
in
impactful
conservation
work
that
offsets
100%

was

provides

this

something
every

Carbon

are
a
big
problem

A
problem
to
address
now

not
in
20
or
30
years

And
when
you
break
it
down

theyâ€™re
more
manageable
than
you
might
think

Most
brands
can
start
by
measuring
and
offsetting
their
carbon
emissions
for
less
than
0
5%
of
revenues

It
may
feel
like
a
small
step

but
if
all
companies
did
it

we'd
be
much
closer
to
living
in
a
net-zero
world

Climate
Neutral
x
Novata
We
have
always
believed
that
carbon
estimation
should
be
easy
and
accessible

Our
new
partnership
with
Novata
expands
impact
by
getting
more
companies
to
estimate
their
emissions

Milestone
This
52nd
Earth
Day
we
announce
our
first
group
of
Climate
Neutral
Certified
companies
for
2022
and
celebrate
their
decision
to
Invest
in
Our
Planet

Understanding
How
Consumers
Value
Climate
Neutral
Certification
Is
going
carbon
neutral
more
beneficial
to
companies
than
expected?
New
research

suggests
green
actions
can
drive
the
bottom
line
by
putting

review
by
Laura
Roberts
I
have
tried
several
shampoo
bars
from
different
companies
in
the
last
year

These
are
by
far
the
best
quality
I
have
tried

My
hair
is
full

and
shiny

as
well
as
NOT
dry

I
have
blonde

thin
hair
that
can
be
oily

I
don't
have
to
wash
my
hair
everyday
using
this
product!
Which
is
much
healthier

I
have
stopped
using
my
salon
shampoo
all
together!!
Yay

no
more
plastic

The
shampoo
bar
lathers
very
nicely
and
smells
light
and
not
too
much
perfume

I
use
the
corresponding
conditioner
as
well

The
conditioning
bar
lasts
about
a
third
longer
than
the
shampoo
bar

so
keep
that
in
mind
when
ordering

Mike

shared
some
stories
and
photos
with
the
#AlpinistCommunityProject
about
an
expedition
to
Greenland
in
2015
to
climb
a
remote

unclimbed
peak

which
he'd
named
the
Polar
Bear
Fang
after
finding
it
on
maps
and
reconnoitering
the
approach
by
boat
on
different
trips
through
the
years

He
had
tried
to
reach
the
Fang—which
he
is
certain
is
in
a
never-before
visited
area—on
several
occasions

but
he
had
been
shut
down
nearly
every
time
because
of
sea
ice

and
once
because
there
were
too
many
polar
bears
to
get
off
the
boat

On
this
last
attempt

he'd
planned
to
go
alone

but
that
quickly
changed

Dispatches

Description
Our
mission
was
simple

develop
a
detergent
that
whitens
and
brightens
as
well
as
the
household
brands

but
without
leaving
plastic
of
ANY
kind
-
in
landfills
or
waterways
-
behind

Our
solution
was
to
take
an
old
technology
-
laundry
powder
-
and
give
it
a
modern
boost
by
concentrating
it
so
that
you
only
need
one
teaspoon
per
light
load

1
tablespoon
for
heavier
loads

The
result
is
a
highly
efficient
detergent
that
is
good
for
your
clothes
and
our
planet

Whatâ€™s
Inside?
Safe

the

toxicity)

Have
not
tried
this
as
it
will
be
part
of
a
present
for
Mom

but
I
sure
can
speak
to
the
Sellerâ€™s
amazing
customer
service

They
went
above
and
beyond
and
somehow
managed
to
add
this
on
to
an
existing
purchase
Iâ€™d
made
to
save
me
some
$
on
the
shipping

I
definitely
look
forward
to
future
purchases!
Thank
you

I
was
nervous

I
will
admit
but
daaang
this
is
awesome!
I
don't
like
when
laundry
has
a
really
bold
smell
as
I
get
a
headache
but
this
is
the
perfect
amount!
It's
a
soft
but
DEFINITE
"clean"
smell
(and
I
leave
my
gym
stuff
in
the
hamper
a
while
so
that's
saying
something
hah)

A
small
amount
goes
a
long
way

I'll
see
if
I
can
update
my
review
once
I
was
some
stinky
gym
clothes
but
as
of
yet
my
clothes
are
coming
out
clean
with
a
nice
scent

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

CMS
is
a
content
management
system
software

implemented
as
a
Web
application

for
creating
and
managing
HTML
content

It
is
used
to
manage
and
control
a
large

dynamic
collection
of
Web
material
(HTML
documents
and
their
associated
images)

A
CMS
facilitates
content
creation

content
control

editing

and
essential
Web
maintenance
functions

CMS
developed
by
Lead
Infosoft
used
to
be
very
very
user
friendly

so
that
a
non-technical
person
can
also
easily
manage
their
website
or
an
application

We
provide
the
service
of
developing
CMS
depending
upon
the
customers
need

Generally
we
use

by
Lead
Infosoft
has
extra
security
mechanism

we
call
it
a
2nd

security

It
prevents
un-authorized
access
to
the
panel
and
secures
data
of
our
client

It
keeps
all
activity
logs
done
on
CMS
which
can
be
used
to
track
usage
of
CMS

Spectacular
product

Totally
nailed
the
transition
between
the
conditioner
bar
and
the
cream

The
coconut
scent
leaves
just
a
hint

so
it
is
not
overbearing

Thanks
to
Etee

I
am
about
70%
plastic
free
with
my
personal
care
and
household
products

with
upgraded
quality
for
sure

This
smells
so
good
and
works
great
on
my
hair

My
hair
is
really
fine
and
it
doesnâ€™t
weigh
it
down
either

I
love
it!

Description
YOUR
BODY


OUR
PLANET
The
perfect
pairing
to
our
Concentrated
DewDrop
Conditioner
Bar-
this
shampoo
bar
was
developed
from
the
same
chemistry
as
a
top-performing
'liquid'
equivalent

With
its
rich
and
creamy
texture

it
will
moisturize
your
hair
without
weighing
it
down

Made
for
dry/damaged
hair

we
wanted
something
that
would
provide
repair
and
hydration

Leaving
it
feeling
soft

fresh

and
full
of
moisture

Each
bar
is
60g
and
will
replace
approximately
2-3
plastic
shampoo
bottles
(about
70-80
washes!)

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

Description
YOUR
BODY


OUR
PLANET
Our
*NEW*
Deodorant
Paste
is
aluminum-free
and
lightly
scented
with
a
blend
of
pure
citrus
essential
oils

Itâ€™s
enriched
with
shea
butter
to
help
keep
your
pits
soft
and
smooth

and
a
natural
active
ingredient
made
from
Zinc
with
odor
absorption
efficacy
as
well
as
baking
soda
to
double
up
on
its
odor-blocking
properties

Weâ€™ve
also
ditched
the
PEG
-
a
common
ingredient
found
in
leading
deodorants
known
to
cause
skin
irritation

Refills
will
be
available
in
compostable
beeswax
wraps!
*Note

This
is
a
deodorant

not
an
antiperspirant

HOW

armpits
as
needed

*For

Discontinue
use
if

I
love
the
smell!!
Itâ€™s
a
great
product
and
has
great
coverage

Itâ€™s
a
very
thick
format
but
it
works
well

This
is
a
great
product
-
and
it
works!
(I
know
that
is
more
or
less
expected

but
many
non-conventional
ones
don't)

It
is
easy
to
use/apply

I
highly
recommend
this
product!

Love
this
deodorant

I
was
a
hard
core
native
fan
but
didnâ€™t
like
that
it
was
bought
by
a
larger
brand

This
also
works
so
much
better!

Absolutely
brilliant
product
that
will
change
the
industry

The
idea
was
to
eliminate
plastic

the
result
is
the
first
De-oder-ant

We
started
with
antiperspirants
in
the
late
1950s
with
Stopette

Then
came
deodorants
which
are
basically
cologne
(mixed
with
perspiration
you
get
a
pleasant
masking
smell)

This
product

using
prebiotics

means
don't
stink
by
eliminating
the
bacterial
accumulation
that
causes
the
oder

It
lasts
24
hours
for
me

but
definitely
not
27
hours

My
wife
used
to
alternate
between
three
products
because
after
a
while
one
would
stop
working

Now
she
uses
only
one

this
one
from
ETEE

Information
You’ve
got
a
cool
new
plugin
and
are
hoping
to
give
it
some
exposure

You’re
in
the
right
place

Just
ask
us
to
host
it
for
you

You’ll
be
able
to

Keep
track
of
how
many
people
have
downloaded
it

Let
people
leave
comments
about
your
plugin

Get
your
plugin
rated
against
all
the
other
cool
WordPress
plugins

Give
your
plugin
lots
of
exposure
in
this
centralized
repository

There
are
some
restrictions
Your
plugin
must
be
compatible
with
the
GNU
General
Public
License
v2

or
any
later
version

We
strongly
recommend
using
the
same
license
as
WordPress
â€”
“GPLv2
or
later
”
The
plugin
must
not
do
anything
illegal
or
be
morally
offensive
(that’s
subjective

we
know)

You
have
to
actually
use
the
Subversion
repository
we
give
you
in
order
for
your
plugin
to
show
up
on
this
site

The
WordPress
Plugin
Directory
is
a
hosting
site

not
a
listing
site

The
plugin
must
not
embed
external
links
on
the
public
site
(like
a
“powered
by”
link)
without
explicitly
asking
the
user’s
permission

Your
plugin
must
abide
by
our
list
ofÂ
detailed
guidelines

which
include
not
being
a
spammer
and
not
abusing
the
systems

Submission
is
Simple
Sign
upÂ
for
an
account
on
WordPress
org

Submit
your
plugin
for
review

After
your
plugin
is
manually
reviewed

it
will
either
be
approved
or
you
will
be
emailed
and
asked
to
provide
more
information
and/or
make
corrections

Once
approved

you’ll
be
givenÂ
access
to
a
Subversion
Repository
where
you’ll
store
your
plugin

Shortly
afterÂ
you
uploadÂ
your
plugin
(and
a
readme
file!)
toÂ
that
repository

it
will
be
automatically
displayedÂ
in
the
pluginsÂ
browser

Check
out
the
FAQ
for
more
information

Readme
files
To
make
your
entry
in
the
plugin
browser
most
useful

each
plugin
should
have
a
readme
file
named
readme
txt
that
adheres
to
the
WordPress
plugin
readme
file
standard

You
can
put
your
readme
file
through
the

validator

are

The
easiest
is
through

tech-savvy
folks
prefer
to
download
and
install
it
themselves

way

you
can

review

Kim
Seems
like
a
high
quality

plastic
free
dupe
of
a
well
regarded
conventional
brand

I
wanted
to
switch
back
to
electric
after
having
used
a
manual
bamboo
brush
for
a
few
months
and
my
dentist
recommended
going
back
to
electric

So
far
I
really
like
it
and
hope
it'll
make
the
difference
to
my
dentist!

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

Amazing
discount
but
stupid
when
trying
to
user
I
don't
mind
that
this
didn't
work
on
subscriptions
or
sales/promos

What
I
don't
like
is
that
I
was
going
to
buy
$115
(free
shipping
over
$60)
but
once
you
enter
the
discount
code

I
was
being
forced
to
pay
the
shipping
because
my
total
dropped
to
$15

This
needs
to
be
changed

It
works
great

I
think
I
watered
mine
down
too
much

but
that's
ok

It
still
washes
my
hands
and
smells
great

I
actually
like
these
better
than
ones
I
had
purchased
elsewhere

especially
because
they
have
fluoride

I
know
not
all
people
think
of
fluoride
as
being
beneficial

but
I
like
it

It
was
foamy
after
biting
down
and
at
first
I
thought
that
it
wasn't
enough
toothpaste

but
I
remember
that
dentists
recommend
not
too
much
toothpaste

so
this
is
sufficient

I
have
to
stop
myself
from
using
it
more
than
twice
a
day

I
would
recommend
this

definitely

Great
product
and
packaging

The
concentrated
hand
soap
comes
in
a
wax-like
tube
packaged
in
a
cardboard
container

Easy
to
mix

good
soapy
consistency
and
smells
great

too

This
bar
REALLY
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
do

After
washing

your
hair
will
feel
squeaky
clean

I
thought
that
this
was
not
the
feel
I
needed
if
it
should
have
a
conditioning
effect

It
has
just
the
RIGHT
AMOUNT
of
conditioner
in
the
bar
so
that
your
hair
doesn't
feel
too
slinky

but
conditions
really
well

I
would
prefer
to
have
a
scent

but
I
understand
that
many
men
use
this
bar

so
I
understand

I
ONLY
use

When
I
set
out
to
make
these
wraps
I
wanted
to
accomplish
two
things

1-
Develop
a
reusable
food
wrap
that
is
better
-
in
every
way
-
than
its
plastic
counterparts

2-
Add
some
colour
and
personality
to
the
food
storage
game

And
here's
why
-
plastic
is
not
as
practical
as
once
thought

New
evidence
is
coming
out
-
every
day
-
to
suggest
that
it
leaches
harmful
toxins
and
hormones
into
our
bodies
and
it's
creating
some
major
environmental
issues
because
it
does
not
biodegrade
or
decompose

it
simply
breaks
down
into
infinitely
smaller
plastic
particles
that
can
be
eaten
by
animals

which
means
the
toxins
gradually
work
their
way
back
up
the
food
chain
to
humans

That's
why
we
called
our
company
etee
(Everything
Touches
Everything
Else)

This
isn't
just
a
problem
in
developing
countries
or
out
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean

it's
a
major
issue
everywhere
-
the
great
lakes
of
North
America
-
our
overcrowded
landfills
and
right
in
our
own
back
yards

As
the
father
of
two
little
boys

I
wanted
to
do
something
-
no
matter
how
small
-
to
start
turning
the
tide

so
I
started
exploring
this
ancient
method
of
food
preservation
and
added
some
modern
flourishes

Our
wraps
are
made
with
natural
materials
that
keep
food
fresh
by
forming
a
protective

breathable
seal
over
produce
and
cheese

bowls

sandwiches
and
just
about
any
perishable
-
all
without
the
use
of
plastic

They
are
reusable

They
are

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

Forward-looking
statements
include
all
statements
that
are
not
historical
facts

In
some
cases

forward-looking

can
be
identified
by
terms
such
as
"aim

These

include

(1)

risks
related
to
the
ongoing
COVID-19
pandemic

which
continues
to
impact
our
business
and
results
of
operations
in
numerous
volatile
and
unpredictable
ways

as
well
as
risks
the
e-commerce
gains
experienced
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
do
not
hold
as
the
pandemic
abates

(3)
the
fluctuation
of
our
quarterly
operating
results

(4)

publicly
announced
guidance
or

strategy

strategy
proves
to
be
ineffective

(6)

retain
active

engaged
communities
of
sellers
and
buyers

(7)
macroeconomic
events
that
are
outside
of
our
control

(8)
our
ability
to
recruit
and
retain
employees

(9)
the
importance
to
our
success
of
the
trustworthiness
of
our
marketplaces
and
the
connections
within
our
communities

(10)
our
ability
to
enhance
our
current
offerings

develop
new
offerings
to
respond
to
the
changing
needs
of
sellers
and
buyers

(11)
the

payment
providers

(16)

Depop
and
Elo7
acquisitions

strategy

(17)
acquisitions
that
may
prove
unsuccessful
or
divert
management
attention

and
(18)
the
potential
misuse
or
disclosure
of
sensitive
information
about
members
of
our
communities
and
the
potential
for
cyber-attacks

These
and
other
risks
and
uncertainties
are
more
fully
described
in
our
filings
with
the
Securities

Exchange
Commission

section
entitled
"Risk

10-Q

31

2022
and
subsequent
reports
that
we
file
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission

Moreover

we
operate
in
a
very
competitive
and
rapidly
changing
environment

New
risks
emerge
from
time
to
time

It
is
not
possible
for
our
management
to
predict
all
risks

nor
can
we
assess
the
impact
of
all
factors
on
our
business
or
the
extent
to
which
any
factor

or
combination
of
factors

may
cause
actual
results
to
differ
materially
from
those
contained
in
any
forward-looking
statements
we
may
make

In
light
of
these
risks

uncertainties
and
assumptions

we
cannot
guarantee
future
results

levels
of
activity

performance

achievements

or
events
and
circumstances
reflected
in
the
forward-looking
statements
will
occur

Forward-looking
statements
represent
our
beliefs

assumptions
only
as
of
the
date
hereof

We

I
love
the
facial
cleansing
bar

It
works
well
and
100%
feels
fresh
after
using
it

Again

no
plastic
is
a
great
win
here!

It
smells
great
and
has
a
great
texture

It
doesn't
dry
out
my
skin
and
comes
in
non-plastic
packaging!

Detox
Bar

-
I
love
the
smell!
I
wasnâ€™t
expecting
that
ðŸ‘?ðŸ?»â™¥ï¸?
-
I
somehow
thought
there
would
be
pieces
in
the
soap
for
exfoliation

There
are
no
exfoliating
pieces
Iâ€™ve
seen
so
far

That
being
said
it
cleans
very
well

-
Will
buy
again

It's
easy

Last

the
Forest
Service
and
USDA
announced
that
they
will
work
to
restore

Anyone
can

Many
contributors
focus
on
the
technical
side
of
WordPress

such
as
core
development

there
are
also
teams
working
in
other
areas
like
marketing

translation

training

and
community

There
is
always
a

YOUR
HOME


OUR
PLANET
Our
Floor
Cleaner
gently
lifts
dust

grime

and
foot/paw
prints
while
leaving
an
uplifting
scent
of
the
North
Air
throughout
your
home!
It
performs
just
as
well
as
the
leading
floor
cleaners
on
the
market
-
using
lab-tested
chemistry
-
but
without
the
Plastic
(and
harsh
chemicals)

Simply

a
dispenser
(bottle
or
spray
bottle
of
your
choice)
with
375
ml
(12
5
oz)
of
water

Rip
open
your
pod
of
Floor
Cleaner
Concentrate
over
the
bottle
and
pour
the
concentrate
into
the
water

Screw
on
the
top
and
shake
to
mix

Our
pod
is
â€˜backyardâ€™
compostable

Dispose
of
the
pod
in
the
compost
or
garbage
(rest
assured
it'll
biodegrade
in
either)

Each
pod
makes

400
ml

oz
of

Cleaner

INGREDIENTS

Purified
reverse
osmosis
water

Xanthan
Gum

Potassium
Sorbate

A
blend
of
six
surfactants

Isopropyl
Alcohol

Citric
Acid

North
Air
Synergy
Fragrance

Probiotic
Bacteria
Blend
Purified
Reverse
Osmosis
Water
Used
as
a
solvent
for
the
other
water-soluble
ingredients

This
usually
includes
those
that
impart
skin
benefits

Also
forms
emulsions
with
oils
to
give
the
product
a
more
creamy
texture

Xanthan
Gum
(EWG
=
1)
A
sugar-based

natural
thickener
for
emulsions
and
cleansing
systems

It
readily
swells
with
water
enhancing
the
product's
stability
and
viscosity
without
jeopardizing
the
foaming
capabilities

Potassium
Sorbate
(EWG
=
2)
A
naturally-occurring
salt
that
acts
as
a
food-grade
preservative
to
prevent
harmful
bacteria
from
growing
within
your
products

It
has
been
shown
to
be
non-irritating
and
non-sensitizing
with
toxicity
comparable
to
table
salt
A
blend
of
six
surfactants
A
complement
of
six
biodegradable
surfactants
that
donâ€™t
include
SLS
or
any
ethoxylate
contaminants

The
surfactants
work
to
both
create
a
foamy
lather
and
degrade
any
oil/grease
from
your
floor

Isopropyl
Alcohol
(EWG
=
2)
One
of
the
most
common
disinfectants
available

isopropyl
alcohol
non-selectively
kills
any
microorganism
that
it
encounters
by
destroying
the
bacteriaâ€™s
membrane

In
a
cleaner
it
also
acts
as
an
antifoaming
agent

ensuring
an
easier
clean

Citric
Acid
(EWG
=
1-2)
Acts
as
a
biodegradable
pH
adjuster
(bringing
the
laundry
pH
closer
to
natural
skin
pH)

Helps
surfactants
in
the
cleaner
work
more
effectively

Here

citric
acid
also
works
as
a
stabilizing
agent
for
the
probiotic
bacteria
blend
preventing
the
bacteria
to
activate
early

Probiotic
Bacteria
Blend
A
line
of
Bactizyme
product
that
contains
non-pathogenic
(ie

harmless
to
human)
bacteria
spores

These
bacteria
are
naturally
occurring
in
nature
and
selected
for
their
ability
to
express
enzymes
that
degrade
fat

oils

and
greases

This
leaves
behind
a
selective
bacteria
that
will
out-compete/replace
the
normal
bacteria
that
is
everywhere
and
continue
to
clean
the
floor
after
the
cleaning
is
complete
(i
e

after
the
mop
and
pail
is
put
away)

Not
my
first

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's

apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

Great
product

both
adults
and
teens
love
it

I
would
love
to
be
able
by
in
larger
quantity

possibly
in
a
bag
that
I
can
use
to
refill
the
glass
container

I
was
really
excited
to
get
these
They
foam
up
very
well
and
are
easy
to
chew
I
just
wasnâ€™t
a
fan
of
the
taste
It
was
a
tiny
bit
strong
and
justâ€¦
different
but
these
worked
very
well
I
got
192
tablets
I
got
these
because
I
usually
get
sick
when
I
use
regular
toothpaste
(weird
thing
about
me
thatâ€™s
always
happened)
and
these
I
didnâ€™t
get
sick
at
all
So
for
me
Iâ€™m
definitely
glad
I
got
them!

item
was
shipped
quickly!
is
as
described

I
don't
really
like
the
flavor

I
wish
it
was
a
tad
stronger
so
I
taste
the
mint
after
I
brush

but
my
teeth
are
clean
after
brushing!
cleans
just
as
well
or
better
than
my
regular
tube
paste

HOW
TO
MAKE
YOUR
PLASTIC-FREE
HAND
SOAP
Simply
fill
a
dispenser
or
jar
with
375
ml
(12
5
oz)
of
water

Rip
open
your
pod
of
foaming
hand
soap
concentrate
over
the
jar
and
squeeze
the
soap
into
the
water

Stir
the
mixture

cover
with
a
lid
or
cap
and
give
the
dispenser
a
good
shake

Let
it
sit
for
an
hour
before
first
use

Dispose
of
the
pod
in
the
compost
or
garbage
(rest
assured
it'll
biodegrade
in
either)

Squirt
some
soap
into
your
hands
and
clean
those
hands
like

These
are
so
neat!
My
mom
is
going
to
love
this
easy
to
use
system

Got
here
so
quickly
and
the
shipping
was
so
inexpensive!
A
painless
switch
from
plastic

The
soap
seems
to
be
good
from
what
I
can
salvage

but
be
careful
ordering
this
in
the
dead
of
winter!
This
should
be
at
no
fault
of
Eteeshop

but
I
imagine
due
to
the
Canadian
cold

the
beeswax
pods
were
extra
brittle
and
2
out
of
3
broke
(one
had
entire
chunks
and
the
"top"
come
off
completely

leaking
all
over
the
inside
of
the
cardboard
box

and
the
other
had
a
crack
that
continued
to
leak
the
next
day
after
I
took
it
out
of
the
box)

(
Love
the
idea
of
the
beeswax
instead
of
plastic
packaging

but
I
guess
it
is
more
prone
to
breakage
in
"extreme"
temperatures

I
also
want
to
add
that
I
also
bought
the
dishsoap
pods
and
all
3
of
those
were
in
tact
and
leak-free

So
it's
not
always
going
to
be
a
bad
experience
to
purchase
in
the
winter!
I
wonder
if
maybe
a
"fragile"
sign
on
the
box
might
also
help
though?

have
come
along
way
with
our
pods
however

we
know
improvements
still
need
to
be
made

We
are
currently
testing
an
alternative
to
the
pods
so
please
stay
tuned

D

In
the
meantime

please
email
our
customer
service
team
info@shopetee
com
and
they
will
ship
you
replacement
pods
for
the
ones
that
broke

The
compostable
pods
are
genius

The
soap
smells
nice
and
works
great

Will
definitely
order
again

now
to
try
the
dish
soap

I
love
this
soap

The
product
is
great

the
packaging
is
biodegradable

which
is
fantastic

and
they
are
easy
to
use

I
will
continue
to
buy
these

iLovePDF
We
get
asked
a
lot
of
questions
Here
are
our
answers
to
some
of
the
most
common
ones
Do
my
images
remain
on
your
servers?
Your
pictures
belong
to
you
only

We
just
keep
the
files
in
our
servers
to
allow
you
download
your
edited
images

After

your
files
are
completely
deleted
from
our
system

It
goes
without
saying
that
we
won't
access

view
or
copy
your
files
on
under
no
circumstance

Can
I
use
your
services
for
my
Business?
Definitely

All
uploads
are
encrypted
with
https/SSL
protocol
to
protect
your
privacy

These
supplementary
measures
guarantee
maximum
privacy
and
comply
with
most
of
data
protection
corporate
policies

In
simple
terms

we
process
your
data
in
accordance
with
satisfying
high
standards

What
are
your
system
requirements?
Our
system
requirements
are
pretty
basic

To
run
our
tools
to
its
fullest

we
suggest
you
work
with
the
following
browsers

Chrome

Firefox

Explorer
+10
and
Safari

If
you
experience
any
issues

drop
us
an
email

We
will
try
to
respond
within
2
working
days

Why
haven't
I
received
a
confirmation
email
yet?
You
should
receive
the
email
to
confirm
your
account
shortly
after
registering

Should
this
not
be
the
case

please
check
your
Spam/Trash
Folder
to
make
sure
it
didn't
end
up
there

Besides

you
can
always
send
us
an
email

We
will
happily
help
you
confirm
your
account

How
can
I
select
images
from
my
computer?
There
are
two
ways
to
quickly
upload
your
pictures

You
can
drag
and
drop
your
images
from
your
desktop
straight
to
our
page

Or
you
can
select
your
pictures
by
clicking
on
them
individually

For
multiple
selection

when
files
are
ordered
consecutively

click
the
first
one
and
the
last
one
you
want
to
select
whilst
holding
on
the
"Shift"
key

Can
I
choose
the
compression
level?
Nope

Our
compressor
has
been
designed
to
provide
the
highest
compression
level
without
lowering
the
quality
of
your
images

thatâ€™s
why
you
can't
modify
the
compression
level

Once
your
pictures
have
been
processed

you
will
see
the
percentage
of
compression

When
it
comes
to
compressed
images

we
can't
compress
them
any
further

If
you
claim
to
be
very
fast

why
is
my
conversion
taking
ages?
Well

you
know

unfortunately
not
everything
depends
on
us

Despite
our
fast
working
servers

the
time
that
your
images
take
to
get
converted
will
be
determined
by
your
own
Internet
connection
and
the
size
of
the
selected
images

Sorry
about
that

What
does
it
mean
that
I
can
work
from
the
cloud?
That
means
that
you
don't
need
to
have
the
images
you
want
to
process
in
the
same
device
from
which
you
are
working

If
you
are
registered
on
Google
Drive
or
Dropbox

you
can
download
your
files
directly
to
our
page

After
processing

you
can
save
them
back
to
your
cloud-based
accounts

Can
I
get
extra
charged
if
I
exceed
my
user
limits?
Well

you
technically
canâ€™t
exceed
your
limits

If
you
try
to
upload
too
many
or
too
big
files
for
your
userâ€™s
plan

a
message
will
pop
up
preventing
you
to
proceed

If
you
see
these
messages
quite
often

maybe
you
should
start
thinking
about
upgrading
your
account

Why
the
page
doesn't
work
correctly?
Whether
you
canâ€™t
upload
your
files

or
some
page
functions
donâ€™t
work
properly

try
turning
off
web
extensions
such
AdBlock

Sometimes
these
extensions
may
prevent
our
tools
to
deliver
its
full
functionality

We
promise
our
ads
will
lead
to
minimal
disturbance!
If
the
problem
is
still
unresolved

try
Incognito
browsing

After
converting
my
file

the
outcoming
document
looks
different

Only
very
rarely

after
conversion

your
document
may
have
some
format
changes

This
can
happen
due
to
processing
errors

Although
that
hardly
ever
happens

if
this
situation
does
occur

please
send
us
a
report

We
will
do
our
best
to
help
you
fix
the
issue

I
need
help

How
can
I
reach
you?
Although
we
designed
iLoveIMG
to
be
very
simple

we
all
might
need
help
sometimes

And

of
course

we
canâ€™t
foresee
every
technical
issue

So

for
every
question

suggestion
or
claim
our
support
team
is
right
here
for
you

Contact
us
by
email
and
weâ€™ll
try
to
give
you
an
answer
within
24-48h
max

that
they
live
in
(ie
their

healthy

so
having

100%

(total
of
60
metres
of
floss
in
each
2

box
-
that's
2/3
the
length
of
a
football
field
of

So

let's
get

not
only
is
your
dental
floss
more
environmentally
friendly
it
actually
is
now
my
favorite
floss
for
texture

thickness

strength

Great
floss!
Love
that
it
comes
with
a
glass
dispenser

I
donâ€™t
know
if
this
is
all
silk
floss
or
just
my
teeth

but
I
have
found
it
frays
a
little
easier
than
I
was
expecting

But
still
worth
it
and
Iâ€™d
buy
again!

itâ€™s
great!!
a
little
thick
string

could
be
thinner
and
it
tends
to
fray

still
pretty
good
esp

for
low
waste
bffs

Description
etee
is
big
on
keeping
their
chompers
and
the
houses
that
they
live
in
(ie
their
gums)
healthy

so
having
a
plastic-free
floss
option
was
a
no-brainer
over
in
these
parts

Each
spool
contains
30
metres
of
our
100%
pure
mulberry
silk

candelilla
wax
and
natural
peppermint
oil
floss
(total
of
60
metres
of
floss
in
each
2
spool
box
-
that's
2/3
the
length
of
a
football
field
of
floss!)
So

let's
get
flossin'
(and
we
ain't
talkin'
about
that
fancy
dance
all
the
kids
are
doing
these
days)!
Completely
biodegradable


plastic-free
floss
to
keep
your
entire
family's
teeth
healthy!

Love
this
excellent
floss

Itâ€™s
strong
yet
gentle
on
my
gums

I
love
that
it
is
so
compact
and
that
it
eliminates
another
plastic
container
from
my
life

The
container
is
a
little
precarious
as
the
floss
will
not
always
stay
out
and
is
not
too
easy
to
grab

Just
the
heads
up
here

The
product
itself
is
wonderful

Cheers

Dispatches

small
business
in
Canada
Description
A
perfect
dispenser
to
house
your
new
dish
or
hand
soap!
Grab
a
16
oz
glass
mason
jar
with
either
a
stainless
steel
or
black
pump
top
(with
a
plastic
straw
-
this
pump
has
the
least
plastic
that
we
could
source
and
is
offered
only
due
to
popular
demand)

Either
option
is
easy
to
use

slick

classy

and
looks
great
on
your
kitchen
counter

Or
you
may
already
have
a
mason
jar
and
just
need
the
top

We
have
that
option
available
as
well

I
just
received
my
dish
soap
pods
and
my
glass
soap
dispenser
and
I
am
thrilled

I
can't
believe
how
quickly
it
was
delivered

I
followed
the
instructions
and
I
have
started
using
my
dish
soap
and
it
works
great

I
like
the
glass
soap
dispenser
and
it
looks
so
nice
on
my
counter

The
dish
soap
works
great
and
after
I
have
finished
these
3
pods
I
will
definitely
be
ordering
from
this
business
again

This
is
as
described

Seems
fine!
We
haven't
actually
used
it
yet
(which
is
why
I'm
giving
it
four
starts
instead
of
five)

but
it
looks
pretty
sturdy

The
top
seems
to
be
quite
durable
and
I
am
just
starting
to
use

Nice
to
know
that
can
be
used
on
a
mason
jar

I
only
got
the
top

Goodbye
to
Dry
Lips
(and
plastic!)
with
this
JUMBO
tube
of
smoothing

the
bomb)

With
12
grams
(
42oz)
of
natural

moisturizing
lip
balm
you
get
nearly
3x
the
typical
4
25
gram
(
14oz)
tubes
you'd
find
at
your
local
drug
store
-
except
without
that
nasty
plastic
tube!
It's
all
housed
in
a
biodegradable
paper
tube
-
good
for
you

great
for
our

Took
a
while
to
ship
and
arrive

but
the
grapefruit
is
delicious
and
refreshing
and
the
size
of
the
tube
is
much
bigger
than
other
paper
tube
lip
balms
I've
tried

Smells
so
good!
I'm
happy
to
have
a
a
lip
balm
that
doesn't
come
in
a
plastic
tube!
Moisturizes
my
lips
nicely

How
fit
do
I
need
to
be?
This
tour
is
beginner-friendly
but
requires
you
to
have
decent
fitness
levels

You
will
need
to
be
able
to
bike
consistently
on
varied
and
sometimes
steep
terrain

Even
the
beginner
tours
will
take
you
up
to
a
height
of
200
to
500
m
above
sea
level

There
will
be
no
time
constraints

In
case
the
trail
is
too
challenging
for
you

you
are
always
permitted
to
push
your
bike
Â
With
two
experienced
guides

you
can
explore
different
types
and
levels
of
biking
trails
in
the
area

Split
into
two
groups
and
mix


match
the
routes
according
to
your
skill
and
preference

If
you
want
to
take
a
day
or
two
off

feel
free
to
stay
on
the
catamaran
or
go
on
another
outdoor
adventure
like
hiking
or
kayaking
(not
included
in
the
cost
of
the
trip)

What
if
Iâ€™ve
never
mountain
biked
before?
As
long
as
you
pedal
on
two
wheels

you
can
book
this
adventure

A
guide
will
explain
the
different
mountain
bike
techniques
and
body
positions
to
get
you
feeling
comfortable
on
the
trail

You
will
progress
at
a
level
that
is
consistent
with
your
comfort

Once
you
finally
get
the
hang
of
trail
riding

you
will
only
want
more!
Keep
in
mind
that
you’ll
spend
most
of
the
day
on
trails
and
that
the
weather
can
get
very
hot
in
the
summer

weather?

Mediterranean
climate
boasts

weather
year-round

conditions

When
the
weather
does
not
cooperate

your
guide
will
know
the
correct
course
of
action
to
take

Whether
thatâ€™s
shifting
to
a
more
favorable
location
or
postponing
until
conditions
approve

your
guide
will
know
just
what
to
do

In
the
event
of
predictably
bad
weather

you
will
be
contacted
prior
to
the
trip

review
by
Shannon
Bruce
I
really
like
this

You
can
have
as
much
or
as
little
as
you
like
just
by
letting
it
melt

The
smell
is
tangerine
which
is
lovely

Definitely
a
must
have!

This
lotion
is
still
a
bit
too
dry
for
me

itâ€™s
more
of
a
salve

The
shampoo
and
conditioner
bars
are
incredible

however!!!!
Replaced
my
regular
shampoo
and
conditioner

my
hair
has
never
felt
so
soft

I
love
it

Made
with

this
shampoo
is
ready

The
active
ingredient
is
a
hair
conditioner
that
improves
hair
combability
and
manageability

Additionally

it
has
been
shown
to
positively
influence
the
mechanical
properties
of
hair
to
protect
against
fading
of
hair
colour
in
dyed
hair

It
also
effectively
protects
hair
against
heat
that
is
applied
during
hair
straightening

I
love
the
shampoo
bars

I've
been
using
them
for
about
9
months
now
and
they
work
beautifully
on
my
fine
hair

without
leaving
it
greasy
like
some
shampoo
bars

My
only
reason
for
giving
it
4
stars
is
the
smell
is
not
my
fave

I
prefer
the
lavender

But
it
works!
And
I
am
always
raving
to
people
wanting
plastic
free
solutions
for
home
consumable
products

love
eTee!

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

over
900
miles
of
hiking
trails

see
all
the
sights

Did
you
know
that
this
is
one
of
the
last

temperate

Or
that
Native
Americans

region
for
over
11
000
years?
And
have
you

gigantic
magma
chambers
lying
beneath
the
park’s

a

BISON
Bison
have
continuously
inhabited
the
Yellowstone
area
since
prehistoric
times

A
century
ago

this
ancient
herd
faced
certain
extinction
due
to
extensive
poaching

but
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
park
employees

their
numbers
have
grown
from
a
meager
two
dozen
to
over
5
000
free-ranging
bison

BEARS
Yellowstone
is
home
to
two
famous
species
of
bears

black
bears
and
grizzly
bears

The
black
bear
is
commonly
found
all
over
North
America
and
is
usually
smaller
and
less
aggressive

The
grizzly
bear
inhabits
a
few
isolated
locations
in
the
lower
48
and
can
be
recognized
by
the
pronounced
hump
between
its
shoulders

ELK
Elk
are
the
most
commonly
found
large
mammals
in
Yellowstone

Currently

there
are
between
10
000-20
000
living
in
the
Greater
Yellowstone
Ecosystem

Only
males
have
antlers

which
they
shed
in
spring

They
immediately
start
growing
again

reaching
up
to
30
pounds
per
pair

WOLVES
After
going
extinct
in
1926

wolves
were
reintroduced
into
Yellowstone
in
the
mid-1990s

Their
most
common
prey
are
elk
and
bison

Currently

around
100
wolves
live
in
the
park

Their
return
to
Yellowstone
has
brought
about
an
increase
in
beaver
population
and
the
recovery
of
vegetation
such
as
willow
and
aspen

BEAVERS
Although
small
in
stature

beavers
are
one
of
the
most
influential
species
inhabiting
the
Yellowstone
wilderness

They
are
responsible
for
diverting
streams
and
cutting
down
trees

which
leads
to
changes
in
habitat
structures

There
are
over
100
colonies
living
in
the
park

BALD
EAGLES
Celebrated
as
the
national
symbol
of
the
United
States

the
bald
eagle
can
be
found
perched
above
the
lakes
and
rivers
of
Yellowstone

hunting
for
fish
below

Their
population
decreased
dramatically
in
the
1900s

but
since
2007
bald
eagles
have
been
removed
from
the
list
of
endangered
species

BIGHORN
SHEEP
Named
after
the
large

curved
horns
belonging
to
males

bighorn
sheep
are
mainly
found
in
the
northern
part
of
Yellowstone
National
Park

They
frequently
display
their
athleticism
on
steep

rocky
terrain
and
provide
entertainment
for
onlookers
with
loud
clangs
of
clashing
horns
during
fights

MOOSE
Moose
are
the
largest
members
of
the
deer
family

They’re
usually
found
in
the
forested
areas
and
willow
flats
in
the
southwestern
corner
of
Yellowstone
and
near
certain
creeks
and
rivers

In
recent
years

fires
and
competition
in
the
form
of
elk
and
bison
have
led
to
a
decrease
in
their
population

My
wife
and
I
spent
five

with
Cara
In

was

away
are
just

of
the
many
highlights

natural
wonders
that
we
were
in
complete
awe
of

Cara’s
knowledge

enthusiasm

and
extensive
knowledge
were
simply
contagious
The
equipment
she
used
was
top
notch

Her
passion
for
the
animals
we
witnessed
made
the
trip
so
worthwhile

Her
easy
going
demeanor
made
conversation
easy
and
informative

Every
person
we
came
in
contact
with
in
the
park
spoke
highly
regarding
Cara’s
stellar
reputation
as
a
wildlife
guide

and
she
truly
surpassed
our
highest
of
expectations
going
into
the
trip

Her
ability
to
spot
wildlife
is
no
less
than
remarkable
(and
I
thought
I
had
good
eyesight!)
The
only
way
to
truly
experience
the
Serengeti
we
witnessed
in
Yellowstone
National
Park
is
to
take
Cara
from
In
Our
Nature
Guiding
Services
and
be
prepared
to
be
surprised

excited

and
truly
inspired

I
am
in
the
process
of
booking
my
trip
with
Cara
for
next
year

Her
indelible
impact
on
our
excursions
is
one
we
are
both
thankful
and
appreciative

Hike
in
Cinque
Terre
and
the
Mountains
of
Tuscany
Italy’s
geography
is
governed
by
two
contrasting
forces—sea
and
stone

The
warm
Mediterranean
gives
life
to
the
olive
groves
and
painted
towns
of
the
Italian
Riviera

while
the
rugged
Apennine
Mountains
form
the
backbone
of
the
boot-shaped
peninsula

Discover
both
faces
on
this
two-week
hiking
tour

split
between
the
picturesque
coastline
of
Liguria
and
the
rugged
ridges
of
Tuscany

However

if
seven
days
in
Italy
is
enough
for
you

feel
free
to
choose
only
one
region
to
visit

Whichever
it
may
be

when
the
time
comes
to
say
arrivederci

you’ll
understand
why
they
call
it
Bel
Paese—the
beautiful
country

This
boot
is
made
for
hiking—and
that’s
just
what
you’ll
do
Your
Italian
idyll
starts
in
Cinque
Terre

a
colorful
coastal
community
shaped
by
its
historical
isolation

For
centuries

the
only
way
in
or
out
was
via
a
thin
thread
of
walking
paths

Those
footpaths
are
the
same
seaside
promenades
that
flow
through
the
UNESCO-listed
site
today

Cross
into
neighboring
Tuscany
expecting
vistas
of
sun-kissed
vineyards
and
you
might
be
surprised

Instead

you’ll
follow
the
hidden
trails
of
the
Garfagnana
Valley
along
rolling
alpine
meadows

up
to
towering
peaks
that
vanish
in
the
clouds

These
are
Tuscan
treasures
you
won’t
find
in
tourist
brochures

Two
weeks

two
itineraries—one
feast
for
the
senses
FROM
SEASIDE
STROLLS
TO
ALPINE
TREKS
While
the
Cinque
Terre
hike
itself
is
only
11
km
long

you’ll
spend
seven
days
exploring
the
sights
and
side
trails
of
each
stop
on
the
tour

Sample
the
flavors
of
local
cuisine

amble
along
vine-strewn
terraces

and
take
in
the
Ligurian
panoramas
from
hilltop
overlooks

Your
homebase
for
the
second
week
will
be
the
newly
restored
Lavacchio
Farm

an
organic
oasis
where
there
are
no
guests

only
friends

After
5-7
hours
of
hiking
in
the
mountains
of
Tuscany

coming
back
to
a
homemade
meal

fine
wine
and
a
swim
in
the
pool
feels
like
paradise

An
awe-inspiring
experience
awaits
Take
five
and
enjoy
life
in
Cinque
Terre
A
QUINTESSENTIAL
QUINTET
OF
TREKS
The
hamlets
of
Cinque
Terre
mushroom
out
of
the
cliffs
above
the
Ligurian
Sea
in
splashes
of
bright
pastel

Get
ready
for
a
colorful
week
of
hiking
in
these
five
fishing
villages
strung
together
by
age-old
mule
tracks
and
dusty
roads

As
the
day
winds
down

enjoy
a
refreshing
aperitivo
from
the
comfort
of
your
seaside
hotel

Between
dips
in
the
sea

wine
tasting
sessions
in
Levanto
and
sunset
dinners
in
Riomaggiore

you’ll
visit
medieval
fortresses

stroll
through
shaded
orchards

and
hike
on
the
centuries-old
stone
terraces
carved
into
the
hillside

These
sprawling
structures
are
a
testament
to
the
ingenuity
and
spirit
of
the
local
people

FEEL
THE
OLD-TIME
CHARM
With
its
relaxed
atmosphere

ancient
architecture
and
total
absence
of
traffic
(cars
cannot
enter
the
villages)

Cinque
Terre
feels
like
a
portal
to
a
bygone
era

There
is
a
19th
century
railway
line
cutting
through
the
hillside

but
most
of
the
time
you’ll
get
around
like
in
the
old
days

Take
a
boat
ride
to
the
solemn
church
of
Porto
Venere
where
Lord
Bryon
penned
some
of
his
best-known
verses

And
if
that
doesn’t
whet
your
spiritual
appetite

complete
the
Way
of
the
Sanctuaries

a
special
trail
that
connects
the
800-year-old
shrines
belonging
to
each
of
the
five
villages

Uncover
the
wild
side
of
Tuscany
IN
THE
FOOTSTEPS
OF
POETS
AND
PARTISANS
Leaving
the
dolce
vita
vibes
behind

set
your
sights
on
bigger
and
bolder
things

Your
second
week
takes
place
on
the
craggy
kings
of
Tuscany—the
Apuan
Alps
and
the
Apennine
Mountains

Make
your
way
through
the
densely
forested
Garfagnana
Valley
while
stopping
at
abandoned
villages

WW2
memorials
and
historic
churches

This
is
an
area
steeped
in
history—just
as
Dante
traveled
these
mountains
in
search
of
inspiration

Italian
partisans
found
freedom
on
its
long-forgotten
paths

As
you
forge
on
along
the
snaking
ridgeline

the
Apennine
Mountains

you’ll
feel
like
you’re
treading
on
the
backs
of
sleeping
giants

Expect
your
hikes
to
grow
longer
and
the
vistas
more
arresting

The
penultimate
finish
line
is
at
Prado

the
roof
of
Tuscany

where
the
view
stretches
500
km
into
the
distance

Then

for
your
last
hike
of
the
tour

conquer
the
Apuan
Alps—Italy’s
Mountains
of
Marble—where
the
world’s
purest
has
been
quarried
since
Roman
times

Michelangelo
sculpted
David
out
of

you
will
carve

I
recently
did
the
guided
tour
of
the
cinque

I
don’t
often
provide
feedback
but
this
tour
was
amazing

You
can’t
go
wrong
when
you
have
a
back
drop
of
the
cinque
terre
but
what
made
the
tour
was
the
very
knowledgable
guide
Stefano

His
knowledge
of
the
Cinque
Terre
walks

history
and
nature
was
fantastic

he
was
always
willing
to
answer
our
questions

It
was
great
having
an
Italian
guide

not
only
did
we
learn
about
the
region
but
also
Italian
culture
in
general

The
food
and
accommodation
was
also
very
good

Not
my
first

I
bought
several
sets

years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

How
Twitter
Ads
work
We
want
to
show
you
ads
that
you
find
interesting
and
useful

Here's
an
overview
of
how
Twitter
Ads
work

why
you
see
certain
ads

your
privacy
settings

and
other
options

What
are
Twitter
Ads?
You
may
see
different
kinds
of
ads
on
Twitter

includingÂ
Promoted
Ads

Follower
Ads

and
Trend
Takeover

We
may
show
these
ads
to
you
when
you
are
logged
in
or
logged
out
of
Twitter

They
are
clearly
marked
with
a
â€œPromotedâ€?
icon

You
can
interact
with
most
promoted
content
in
much
the
same
way
as
organic
content

If
you
follow

like

or
Retweet
content
on
Twitter

including
promoted
content

your
followers
may
see
your
name
associated
with
that
content

Why
you
see
certain
Twitter
Ads
Your
activity
on
Twitter

the
information
you
provide
to
Twitter

and
our
relationships
with
ad
partners
all
help
make
promoted
content
more
relevant
for
you

When
you
use
Twitter
to
follow

Tweet

search

view

or
interact
with
Tweets
or
Twitter
accounts

we
may
use
these
actions
to
customize
Twitter
Ads
for
you

For
example

if
you
search
for
a
specific
term

we
may
show
you
promoted
content
related
to
that
topic

We
also
might
customize
ads
using
other
information
about
you

such
as
your
profile
information

your
mobile
device
location
(if
location
features
are
turned
on)

your
IP
address

or
the
apps
installed
on
your
device

This
helps
us
show
you
local
ads
and
other
ads
that
you
might
prefer

Twitter
may
also
personalize
ads
based
on
information
that
Twitter
and
our
affiliates
collect
and
that
our
ad
partners
share
with
us

such
as
a
hashed
email
address

a
mobile
device
identifier

or
browser-related
information
(a
browser
cookie
ID)

This
helps
Twitter
display
ads
about
things
youâ€™ve
already
shown
interest
in
from
brands
and
businesses
that
you
may
like

For
example

you
could
receive
a
Promoted
Ad
about
a
deal
or
promotion
from
a
business
whose
website
you
frequent

or
email
newsletter
you
subscribe
to

You
could
also
see
this
business
as
a
Follower
Ad
in
one
of
your
"Who
to
Follow"
suggestions

If

Twitter
to
show
you
interest-based

on

easy

You

right
place!

a
veteran
of
iLoveIMG

we
have
designed
our
utilities
to
be
intuitive
and
simple
not
to
add
any
unnecessary
burden
to
your
tasks

We
speak
the
same
language!
It
doesn't
matter
who
you
are

where
you
are
from

what
you
do

as
long
as
you
are
with
us

We
want
you
to
feel
at
home
which
means

being

understand
us
in
your

language

Select
yours
from
the

us
When
it
comes
to
dealing
with
your

it
is
our

and
duty
to
provide

we

We'll
help
you
save
time

Our

Based
in
Barcelona

iLoveIMG
offers
since
2016

simple
and
easy-to-use
image
editing
tools
that
load
fast
and
do
their
job

We
know
firsthand
that
dealing
with
files
can
be
a
time-consuming
burden
at
times

so
we
thought
that
it
would
be
nice
if
you
could
spend
this
time
doing
the
things
that
make
you
happy
instead

When
we
conceived
iLovePDF
back
in
the
day

our
main
goal
was
to
deliver
a
free

accessible
and
top-quality
service
to
satisfy
your
needs
when
managing
PDF
files
online

Thanks
to
you

this
project
happened
to
become
one
of
the
1500
most
visited
internet
websites
and

as
being
useful
to
people
is
what
keep
us
going

the
idea
hit
us

Â¿Why
don't
we
help
you
save
time
when
handling
your
images?
In
this
effort
for
making
the
world
of
online
edition
simpler

we
launched
iLoveIMG

So
now

you
can
easily
modify
images

bulk

fast!
And
save
your
precious
time
for
more
important
concerns

Everything
you
need
for
compressing

cropping

converting

and
resizing
is
right
here

You
can
even
make
animated
GIFs
in
just
a
few
clicks

And

yes

it
is
also
free

We
strongly
believe
that
you
are
the
core
of
our
activity

that's
why
our
small

However

we
are
still

our
brains

kind

just

Our
Story
The
iLovePDF
team
works
with
an
effort
of
making
the
job
of
PDF
edition
easier

From
the
firsthand
experience

we
know
that
dealing
with
PDF
files
can
be
very
time-consuming

WouldnÂ´t
it
be
nice
to
spend
more
time
doing
things
that
make
you
happy
instead
of
stressing
over
PDFs?
Born
and
based
in
Barcelona
in
2010

our
goal
has
always
been
to
offer
a
free

accessible
and
top-quality
service
to
help
you
manage
your
PDFs

This
project
triggered
by
a
personal
need
has
now
become
one
of
the
world
most
visited
websites
and

honestly

being
useful
to
millions
of
people
makes
us
feel
very
lucky

To
meet
your
needs

we
have
launched
two
brand
new
applications

iLovePDF
Mobile
App
allows
you
to
modify
PDF
files
on
the
go

while
iLovePDF
Desktop
enables
you
to
process
files
offline

You
showed
us
that
all
PDFs
problems
were
worth
solving

thatâ€™s
why
our
small
developers
team
work
tirelessly
to
offer
you
an
enjoyable
editing
experience

Because
every
PDF
problem
you
might
have
now

can
be
our
next
challenge

The
Team
We
are
few

yet
a
passionate
few
who
enjoy
creating
solutions
to
help
millions
of
people
around
the
world
with
their
document
needs

Compress
your
PDF
files
and
Stamp
Images
or
text
into
PDF
files

This
is
the
Official
iLovePDF
plugin
for
WordPress

You
can
optimize
all
your
PDF
and
stamp
them
automatically
as
you
do
in
ilovepdf
com

How
it
works
The
plugin
has
two
modes
of
work

automatic
or
manual

Compress
PDF

Every
time
a
PDF
file
is
uploaded
to
your
Media
Library

is
compressed
by
our
iLovePDF
API
and
saved
in
your
WordPress
site
already

space

This
feature
can
be
disabled

It
can
also
compress
all
PDF
already
in
your
Media
Library
at
once
or
compress
PDF
files
one
by
one

The
compression
ratio
depends
on
the
PDF
but
on
average
you
can
save
up
to
50%
of
disk
space
occupied
by
PDF
files
without
loosing
quality

Watermark

Every
time
a
PDF
file
is
uploaded
to
your
Media
Library

is
stamped
by
our
iLovePDF

tools

applied
automatically
when
a
PDF
file
is
upload

so

don’t
need
to
apply
any
manual
anymore

The
ILovePDF
website
is
great

but
their
plugin
isn't

I
gave
it
a
spin
as
I'd
like
the
simple
functionality

focusing
on
compressing
PDF

but
it
wouldn't
work

Actually

it
crashed
the
site
completely

and
support
does
not
seem
to
be
monitored

I
urge
people
to
compress
their
PDF's
manually

and
if
that
is
not
feasible

look
for
a
plugin
that
is
still
maintained
instead

Ever

As
a
globally
recognized
outdoor

the
stakes
were

when
Sea

Born

Australia

Sea

Summit
launched
in
1986
when
Roland
Tyson
started
making
outdoor
gear
to
meet
the
multifaceted
needs
of
outdoor
enthusiasts

The
brand
has
become
synonymous
with
innovative

lightweight
adventure
gear
to
support
expeditions
from
sea
to
summit
Â
The
well-known
manufacturer
in
small

innovative
camp

set
sites
on
releasing
its
most
ambitious

to
boost
sales

and
garner
industry
acclaim
while
instilling
consumer
trust
in
the
new
category

The
brandâ€™s
launch
into
lightweight
tents
was
ambitious

setting
out
to
design
the
best
tent
possible

The
project
was
a
multi-million
dollar
investment
and
took
three
years
of
research
and
design

After
many
iterations

the
brand
launched
two
lightweight
tent
models
in
2021

the
Telos
and
Alto
Â
The
value
proposition
included
interwoven

small
design
stories

from
tent
stakes

to
pole
design

to
overall
manufacturing

and
user
experience

Without
trade
shows

these
details
would
be
challenging
to
delineate

and
our
team
strategized
a
virtual
launch
to
highlight
the
features
and
lay
the
groundwork
for
sales

The
Telos

successfully
hosted

A
lot
of
tents
in
the
ultralight
category
are
nice
to
carry

but
not
very
nice
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
inside
of

We
wanted
to
design
something
that
was
light
enough
for
long
treks
but
spacious
and
versatile
enough
that
you
enjoy
the
time
you
spend
inside
the
tent
too

Whenever
we
design
a
product

weâ€™re
always
asking
ourselves
â€“
is
this
what
I
want
to
use?

As
the
brand
was
still
relatively
unknown
in
the
tent
category

another
challenge
was
getting
ahead
of
the
consumer
buying
cycle

Purple
Orange
leveraged
keyword
research
to
understand
consumer
purchase
decisions
and
develop
a
media
strategy
to
drive
sales
across
product
discovery
funnels
Â
After
analyzing
over
1
000
keywords

we
developed
a
prioritized
list
of
top-tier
media
outlets
spanning
key
consumer
cohorts

Next

we
leveraged
different
consumer
audiences
to
drive
affiliate
sales
with
outlets
spanning
hunting
and
fishing
verticals
to
mainstream
backpacking
channels
Â
Four
months
after
the
tents
launched

34%
of
the
brandâ€™s
annual
affiliate
sales
had
come
from
tent
traffic
referrals
from
integral
SEO
outlets

I've
been
using
eTee's
shampoo
bars
for
about
9
months
now
and
I
love
them

They
do
not
leave
hair
greasy
like
some
bars

and
the
smell
of
the
lavender
is
lovely!
I'll
continue
to
buy
these
as
a
plastic
free
solution
for
home
that
actually
works
on
my
fine
hair

Congratulations
on
making
great
sustainable
earth
friendly
products

eTee!!!

We
love
the
bar
shampoo

It
smells
great
and
is
environmentally
friendly

They
are
a
higher
price

but
love
the
ETEE
products!

I'm
a
return
customer

I
love
this
shampoo
bar

It
lathers
well

it
rinses
cleanly

it
doesn't
leave
my
hair
all
heavy
and
limp

It
seems
like
it's
pricy

but
it
lasts
and
lasts

and
it's
really
hard
so
it
doesn't
melt
away
when
other
people
forget
to
set
it
out
of
the
range
of
the
shower

YOUR
DISH
SOAP


OUR
PLANET
*jar
not
included
Plastic-free
dish
soap?
Say
it
ain't
so!
etee's
team
of
innovators
have
created
a
natural
pod
that
holds
our
concentrated
dish
soap
so
that
you
can
wave
goodbye
to
the
plastic
dish
soap
bottles
in
the
grocery
aisle
-
see
ya
later!
Each
biodegradable
pod
holds
our
all-natural

bio-based
concentrated
dish
soap
and
is
made
with
100%
plant-based
ingredients

Free
from
SLS

Phthalates

Sulphites

Sulphates

Synthetics
Colourants
or
Fragrance

And
how
about
some
lavender
lime
magic
happening
while
you
soap
up
your
dishes



sounds
good
right?
Each
soap
pod
makes
400
ml
/
13
5
oz
of
dish
soap

These
plastic-free
pods
are
handmade
in
our
Toronto
area
shop

so
you
can
trust
that
not
only
are
our
employees
fairly
treated

they're
also
free
to
goof
it
up
from
time
to
time

We
kept
it
local
by
getting
someone
in
the
Toronto
area
to
formulate
our
dish
soap
concentrate

too!

PLASTIC
OF
ANY
KIND!
How
to
make
your
plastic-free
dish
soap
Simply
fill
a
dispenser
or
jar
with
375
ml
(12
5
oz)
of
water

Rip
open
your
pod
of
concentrated
dish
soap
over
the
jar
and
squeeze
the
soap
into
the
water

Stir
the
mixture

cover
with
a
lid
or
cap
and
give
the
dispenser
a
good
shake

Let
it
sit
for
an
hour
before
first
use

Dispose
of
the
pod
in
the
compost
or
garbage
(rest
assured
it'll
biodegrade
in
either)

Squirt
some
soap
into
your
sink
of
water
or
onto
a
dishcloth
and
clean
those
dishes
like
a
pro

Rinse
any
soap
from
your
dishes
using
hot
water
and
for
best
results
dry
them
with
a
clean
cloth
after
you're
done

Stories
We
think
Etsy
is
pretty
great
but
donâ€™t
take
our
word
for
it

Hear
stories
from
our
sellers
about
how
Etsy
has
made
a
difference
for
them

"My
shop
started
out
as
a
hobby

then
a
side
hustle
to
support
my
teaching
job

When
my
first
son
was
born
in
2014

I
decided
to
grow
it
into
a
full-blown
business

Selling
on
Etsy
has
given
us
the
chance
to
watch
our
kids
grow
while
building
our
business
as
a
family

"I
never
imagined
running
a
vintage
shop
could
make
me
feel
like
I
was
bringing
joy
into
peopleâ€™s
homes

but
thatâ€™s
what
Iâ€™ve
come
to
experience

I
love
that
it
feels
like
a
very
personal
experience
both
as
a
shopper
and
seller

"As
a
mother
of
three
African-American
kids

I
felt
a
drive
to
create
something
for
my
children

and
children
like
them

who
were
unaccustomed
to
seeing
their
likenesses
in
toys

One
of
my
greatest
joys
when
I
launched
my
shop
was
to
have
my
children
come
in

glance
at
my
prints

and
ask
â€˜Oh!
Is
that
me?â€™"

"Sitting
down
at
my
workbench
to
create
continues
to
be
my
lifeline

My

continued
to
grow

Frequently
Asked
Questions
Here
are
some
common
questions
about
selling
on
Etsy

How
do
fees
work
on
Etsy?
Joining
and
starting
a
shop
on
Etsy
is
free

There
are
three
basic
selling
fees

a
listing
fee

a
transaction
fee

and
a
payment
processing
fee

Thereâ€™s
also
an
advertising
fee
for
sales
that
come
from
Offsite
Ads

It
costs
CA$0
26
to
publish
a
listing
to
the
marketplace

A
listing
lasts
for
four
months
or
until
the
item
is
sold

Once
an
item
sells

there
is
a
6
5%
transaction
fee
on
the
sale
price
(including
the
delivery
price
you
set)

If
you
accept
payments
through
Etsy
Payments

we
also
collect
a
3-4%
+
CA$0
25
payment
processing
fee
when
an
item
is
sold

Listing
fees
are
billed
for
$0
20
USD

so
if
your

not
USD

the
amount
may
differ

The
payment
processing
fee
may
also
vary
by

country

Simply
fill
a
dispenser
or
jar
with
375
ml
(12
5
oz)
of
water

Rip
open
your

over
the
jar
and
squeeze
the
soap
into
the
water

cover
with

sit
for
an
hour
before

those
hands

This
is
my
first
of
many
refill
orders

I
am
more
than
happy
with
the
product
and
the
packaging

The
soap
works
wonderfully

the
tubes
are
composable

and
even
the
box
it
was
shipped
in
was
not
huge
or
oversized

Overall
A+
and
will
definitely
be
buying
again!

So
happy
with
my
purchase!
The
fragrance
is
exactly
what
I
was
hoping
for

will
definitely
buy
again

Really
happy
that
the
concentrate
doesn't
separate
from
the
water
too!

I
feel
good
knowing
thereâ€™s
no
plastic
involved

and
the
soap
is
great!
It
costs
a
little
more
than
your
average
bottle
of
soap

but
itâ€™s
worth
it
to
cut
out
plastic
bottles!

YOUR
DISH
SCRUBBIE


OUR
PLANET
Ditch
that
plastic
yellow


green
scrub


sponge
at
last!
Our
plastic-free
Loofie
Scrubber
(affectionately
known
as
'Loofie')
is
a
combination
of
the
gentle
scrubbing
power
of
the
fibrous
loofah
plant
and
the
spongy
cellulose-cotton
cellulose
dishcloth

They're
even
sewn
together
using
cotton
thread
(rather
than
the
all
too
commonly
used
polyester
thread)
which
makes
for
reusable


biodegradable
dish
cleaning
with
absolutely
no
plastic

USE

Loofie
Scrubber

way
you'd
use
your
old
green


blue
plastic
sponge
(but
without
the
plastic!)

The
loofah
side
is
an
amazing
scrubber
-
but
it
won't
scratch
your
dishes!
The
cellulose
side
is
good
for
wiping
up
messy
dishes
and
cleaning
more
delicate
dishes

Loofies
can
do
more
than
clean
dishes
-
try
using
one
to
help
scrub
the
sink


tub

just
like
your
old
plastic
sponge
would!
To
keep
your
Loofie
clean
you
can
chuck
a
damp
one
into
the
microwave
for
10
seconds

or
lay
it
onto
the
top
rack
of
your
dishwasher
for
a
cycle

Washing
machines
or
clothes
dryers
are
not
recommended

Change
your
Loofie
every
3
to
5
weeks

depending
on
usage

When
you're
done
with
it

since
it's
fully
biodegradable

you
can
chuck
it
in
the
garbage

compost
or
bury
it
the
garden

Loofie
will
decompose
within
a
month

INGREDIENTS
Loofies
have
a
layer
of
loofah
plant
paired
with
a
layer
of
cellulose
cloth

which
are
100%
natural
and
made
of
wood


cotton
cellulose

REVIEWS
"I
love
how
it's
made
of
100%
natural
materials
for
something
we
use
on
a
daily
basis
and
something
closest
to
our
mouth

I
was
always
grossed
out
by
thinking
the
bits
and
pieces
of
the
sponge
coming
into
my
body

and
you
know
the
stuff
is
known
for
the
home
of
thousands
of
germs

The
'loofah'
side
is
great
to
scrape
off
food
etc
from
the
dishes

forks
and
knives
without
scratching
them

I
bought
all
of
Etees
items
and
are
going
through
them

Love
the
dish
sponge
(it
doesnâ€™t
feel
like
youâ€™re
holding
a
wet
cat
as
you
do
with
some
other
larger
sponges)

Hand
lotion
is
great
too

Floss
is
okay

hard
to
slide
through
but
cleans
very
well

Packaging
could
be
improved
as
it
was
taped
in
clear
plastic
which
is
not
recyclable
(more
plastic
than
in
the
floss
I
bought)

Iâ€™m
buying
all
the
items
I
liked
so
far
for
sure

Happy
this
is
a
Canadian
small
business

made
here

This
is
the
best
dish
sponge
ever



the
fact
I'm
being
kind
to
the
planet
makes
it
even
better!
I'll
definitely
be
sticking
to
this
sponge
moving
forward

So
happy
to
stop
waging
micro
plastics
down
the
drain
when
scrubbing
dishes

It
works
well
to
wash
surfaces
on
the
blue
side
and
scrub
with
the
sea
sponge
side

Thank
you
for
this
product

YOUR
DISH
SCRUBBIE


OUR
PLANET
Ditch
that
plastic
yellow


green
scrub


sponge
at
last!
Our
plastic-free
Loofie
Scrubber
(affectionately
known
as
'Loofie')
is

scrubbing
power
of
the
fibrous
loofah
plant
and

spongy
cellulose-cotton
cellulose
dishcloth

They're
even
sewn
together
using
cotton
thread
(rather
than
the
all
too

used
polyester
thread)

USE


CARE
Use
your
new
ï»¿eteeï»¿
Loofie
Scrubber
in
the
same
way
you'd
use
your
old
green


blue
plastic
sponge
(but
without
the
plastic!)

The
loofah
side
is
an
amazing
scrubber
-
but
it
won't
scratch
your
dishes!
The
cellulose
side
is
good
for
wiping
up
messy
dishes
and
cleaning
more
delicate
dishes

Loofies
can
do
more
than
clean
dishes
-
try
using
one
to
help
scrub
the
sink


tub

just
like
your
old
plastic
sponge
would!
To
keep
your
Loofie
clean
you
can
chuck
a
damp
one
into
the
microwave
for
10
seconds

or
lay
it
onto
the
top
rack
of
your
dishwasher
for
a
cycle

Washing
machines
or
clothes
dryers
are
not
recommended

Change
your
Loofie
every
3
to
5
weeks

depending
on
usage

When
you're
done
with
it

since
it's
fully
biodegradable

you
can
chuck
it
in
the
garbage

compost
or
bury
it
the
garden

Loofie
will
decompose
within
a
month

INGREDIENTS
Loofies
have
a
layer
of
loofah
plant
paired
with
a
layer
of
cellulose
cloth

which
are
100%
natural
and
made
of
wood


cotton
cellulose

REVIEWS
"I
love
how
it's
made
of
100%
natural
materials
for
something
we
use
on
a
daily
basis
and
something
closest
to
our
mouth

I
was
always
grossed
out
by
thinking
the
bits
and
pieces
of
the
sponge
coming
into
my
body

and
you
know
the
stuff
is
known
for
the
home
of
thousands
of
germs

The
'loofah'
side
is
great
to
scrape
off
food
etc
from
the
dishes

forks
and
knives
without
scratching
them

These
scrubbers
are
the
biggest
surprise

They
last
longer
than
off
the
shelf
sponges

they
have
great
scrubbing
power
and
they
suds
up
with
less
soap!
I
also
donâ€™t
feel
bad
about
throwing
them
in
the
compost
when
they
eventually
fade

Talk
about
a
green
solution!
Love
these

Iâ€™m
never
going
back!

This

Today
is
the
19th
anniversary
since
WordPress’
first
release

which
is
especially
exciting
for
a
number
of
reasons

The
community
put
together
an
awesome
site
celebrating
the
occasion
at
wp19
day

We
just
had
an
awesome
6
0
“Arturo”
release

Next
week
June
2-4
WordCamp
Europe
returns
in-person
in
Porto

Portugal

and
I’ll
be
there
and
so
excited
to
connect
with
the
community!
Tickets
are
still
available

Nineteen
seems
like
an
in-between
number

but
actually
it’s
very
salient
for
me
because
now
WordPress
is
the
same
age
I
was
when
the
first
release
came
out

Which
means
I’ve
now
been
working
on
WordPress
half
my
life!
Cheers
and
here’s
to
many
more
years
together

How
I
Built
This
I
spoke
with
Guy
Raz
about
the
early
days
of
WordPress
and
Automattic
on
the
latest
episode
of
â€œHow
I
Built
This
(listen
on
Pocket
Casts)
â€?
We
ended
up
talking
for
over
four
hours
and
the
show
has
skillfully
edited
this
down
to
just
over
an
hour

We
discussed
my
time
at
CNET

how
I
accidentally
invented
a
new
way
to
spam

why
we
didnâ€™t
sell
Automattic

my
feelings
on
Wix
and
competitors
like
Shopify
(sponsor
of
this
episode

hah

in
which
I
speak
about
how
their
dashboard
looks
just
like
WordPressâ€™s)

Guy
pivoted
the
conversation
to
grief
that
came
with
the
loss
of
my
father
and
challenges
we
faced
during
the
pandemic

He
kept
the
conversation
going
effortlessly
and
I
had
a
great
time
taping
the
episode

Thanks
to
Guy
and
his
team
for
a
great
experience

Junk
Your
Jabra
I
usually
wouldn’t
do
a
post
about
this

but
I
was
so
surprised
I
had
to
share

I
picked
up
a
Jabra
Evolve2
30
UC
wired
headset

with
USB-C

because
my
friend
Hugo
loves
the
wireless
Jabra
and
I’ve
been
using
an
older
USB-A
headset
and
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
not
need
an
adapter

I
also
thought
for
$89
it
must
be
good

The
reviews
were
also
really
solid
(4
3
on
Amazon
right
now)

Do
not
buy
this
headset

There
was
a
constant
buzz/hum
in
the
speaker

people
sounded
lower
quality

and
the
mic
also
was
lower
quality

On
the
plus
side

it
was
a
nice
build
quality
and
comfort

For
$29
cheaper
($60)
the
Sennheiser
SC
135
USB-C
had
better
speaker

way
better
mic
quality

very
nice
build
and
comfort

Get
that
one
instead

So
don’t
mute

get
a
better
headset

Krisp
ai
is
still
great

too

Thirty
Eight
This
is
an
unusually
late
birthday
post
(still
backdated
to
January
11)

I
woke
up
on
my
actual
birthday
and
was
not
feeling
it

I
was
locked
down
even
more
strictly
than
January
2021
because
I
was
trying
to
be
extra
cautious
prior
to
a
surgery
my
Mom
had
later
in
the
month

I
was
also
on
a
fairly
strict
diet
and
exercise
regime
after
slipping
into
a
weight
range
I
wasn’t
comfortable
with

So
I
was
feeling
extra
isolated

had
a
strange
pain
in
my
lower
back

and
I
just
felt
old
all
over

I
thought
of
the
Drake
line

“I’m
really
too
young
to
be
feeling
this
old
”
(Maybe
originally
from
Garth
Brooks?)
I
meditated
with
a
Daily
Calm
from
Jeff
Warren
called
“The
Boggle
”
which
unfortunately
I
can’t
hotlink
but
here’s
how
it
starts

Sometimes
we’re
in
the
boggle

life
is
throwing
everything
at
us

complicated
situations

complicated
relationships

we
have
all
these
feelings

all
these
impulses
pulling
us
in
different
directions

and
we
have
no
idea
what
to
do

No
idea
how
to
resolve
it
all

Even
no
idea
what
self-care
strategy
to
implement
right
now

So
what’s
interesting
about
the
boggle
is
that
there’s
the
challenge
of
the
situation
itself

or
situations

and
there’s
the
added
challenge
of
the
confusion
of
it

the
scrambling
to
make
sense
of
everything

So
we’re
going
to
try
something
different

we’re
going
to
stop
scrambling
and
accept

even
forgive

the
boggle

We’re
going
to
let
ourselves
be
right
here

inside
any
confusion

and
take
a
break
from
trying
to
fix
any
of
it

That’s
the
itinerary

let’s
go

It
hit
close
to
home

and
I’ve
ended
up
returning
to
that
meditation
several
times
since

The
day
really
shaped
up

though!
Friends
surprised
me
with
a
trip
to
a
Teamlab
exhibit
at
a
museum
that
was
closed
on
Tuesdays
but
they
got
opened
up
just
for
us

The
museum
was
magical

but
the
best
part
was
seeing
friends
I
wasn’t
expecting
to

even
if
masked
and
relatively
distanced

I
wore
a
new
comfy
matching
tie
die
outfit
too

because

why
not?
Ended
the
day
with
a
small
dinner
with
Mom
and
three
friends

I
don’t
have
any
particular
wisdom
from
this
birthday
except
no
matter
how
you
feel

take
some
Advil
and
keep
going

This
year
on
the
personal
side
I’d
like
to
take
more
silent
retreats

get
settled
at
home
and
out
of
liminal
states

particularly
construction
projects

and
listen
to
more
operas

On
the
work
side
I’d
like
to
set
up
alternative
ecosystems
for
people
tired
of
the
traditional
options
for
social
with
Tumblr

listening
with
Pocket
Casts

and
writing
with
Day
One

(Update

A
few
weeks
after
my
birthday
I
announced
I’m
working
on
Tumblr
full-time
)
Finally

I’d
like
to
do
my
birthday
post
on
time
next
year

but
I’m
forgiving
myself
for
prioritizing
friends
and
family
that
day

My
birthday
is
coming
up
soon
so
it’s
that
time
of
the
year
when
friends
start
reaching
out
and
asking
where
they
should
fly
to
and
how
we’re
going
to
celebrate

After
a
good
run
in
the
post-vaccinated-and-boosted
part
of
2020
that
felt
relatively
“normal”

including
traveling
almost
200k
miles

I’m
going
back
into
a
pretty
locked-down
state
of
things

Omicron
has
just
been
catching
too
many
friends
and
loved
ones

even
with
fairly
careful
measures
and
testing

So
what’s
happening
on
January
11th?
What
I’m
asking
for
my
birthday
is
for
people
to
blog!
Whether
professionally
on
WP
com

socially
on
Tumblr

or
privately
journaling
with
Day
One

there’s
never
been
a
better
time
to
stop
being
a
passive
consumer
of
the
internet
and
join
the
class
of
creators

Write
for
a
single
person

Share
something
cool
you
found

Summarize
your
year

Set
a
blogging
goal
with
reminders

Get
a
Gutenberg-native
theme
and
play
around
with
building
richer
posts

Start
a
nom
de
plume

Answer
daily
prompts
on
Day
One

Forget
the
metaverse

let’s
hang
out
in
the
blogosphere

Get
your
own
domain!
If
you’re
a
close
friend
that
feels
intimidated
by
the
software
at
all
or
that
you
don’t
know
where
to
start

I’m
happy
to
hop
on
a
Zoom
to
go
through
everything
on
a
screen
share

That
will
also
be
a
great
learning
for
me
for
places
we
can
improve
things

which
is
also
a
fantastic
gift!

David
Pierce
wrote
a
deep
profile

over
4
000
words

for
Protocol
and
asks
the
question
in
the
headline

Can
Matt
Mullenweg
save
the
internet?
Which
brings
to
mind
Betteridge’s
law
of
headlines
(nÃ©e
Hinchliffe’s
rule)

“Any
headline
that
ends
in
a
question
mark
can
be
answered
by
the
word
no
”
I
can’t
save
the
internet

But
you
know
who
can?
A
movement

A
community
of
like-minded
individuals

unified
by
a
common
philosophy

and
working
together
to
create
tools
of
freedom

It’s
a
human
right
to
be
able
to
see
how
that
technology
works
and
modify
it

Itâ€™s
as
key
to
freedom
as
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
religion

So
that
is
what
I
plan
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
fighting
for

Working
together
we’ve
created
something
special

unlike
anything
the
internet
has
seen
before

and
I’m
excited
to
continue

State

Update

Here’s
the
recording!
I’m
very
excited
that
we’ll
be
broadcasting
the
State
of
the
Word
“live
from
New
York
City”
this
coming
Tuesday

December
14th!
There
will
be
a
very
small
“studio
audience”
of
community
members
there
in
person

Recording
the
solo
version
last
year
was
actually
one
of
the
hardest
things
I’ve
done
in
a
long
time

It’s
funny

with
a
live
audience
I
can
comfortably
present
for
an
hour
no
problem

but
recording
that
25
minute
presentation

alone
in
a
room
staring
at
a
camera

was
an
excruciating
process
over
two
days
and
dozens
of
takes

I
got
the
advice
afterward
that
even
if
you’re
just
staring
into
a
camera

it
can
be
helpful
to
have
an
“audience”
of
a
few
friends
in
the
room

Even
more
than
that

though

I’m
positively
giddy
to
see
some
of
my
friends
from
the
WordPress
community
in
person
for
the
first
time
in
several
years

Please
join
via
streaming
on
the
14th

and
also
there
will
also
be
at
least
20
watch
parties
around
the
globe
if
there’s
one
in
your
neighborhood

Looking
forward
to
catching
up

celebrating
the
community’s
accomplishments
over
the
last
year

and
hopefully
raising
a
torch
for
our
march
toward
freedom
on
the
web
in
2022

to
Join
Automattic
Since
Frontity
launched
their
open
source
framework

they
have
been
making
the
integration
between
React
and
WordPress
easier

Their
proven
drive
and
experience
with
clean
technological
solutions
will
benefit
our
efforts
as
we
continue
to
make
the
block
and
theme
APIs
a
joy
to
use
and
WordPress
the
best
development
platform
on
the
web

The
next
step
in
the
growth
of
this
relationship
is
for
Frontity
and
its
team
to
join
Automattic
and
contribute
to
core
WordPress
org
as
part
of
our
commitment
to
Five
for
the
Future

I
believe
thereâ€™s
still
a
lot
that
we
can
learn
from
decoupled
systems
and
we
can
incorporate
those
learnings
into
WordPress
itself
as
we
emphasize
performance

flexibility

and
ease
of
development

I
look
forward
to
Frontity
joining
WordPress
and
channeling
their
efforts
into
the
WordPress
APIs

documentation

and

on
Funding

Buyback

and
Hiring
In
February
of
this
year

Automattic
closed
a
new
primary
funding
round
of
$288M

bringing
in
some
great
new
partners
including
BlackRock

Wellington

Schonfeld

and
Alta
Park

Existing
investors
ICONIQ
and
AglaÃ©
(Bernard
Arnault)
also
participated

This
round
was
common
stock

and
like
all
funding
since
2011

included
a
proxy
assigning
me
the
right
to
vote
the
shares

Automattic
was
very
busy
during
this
time
frame

as
we
were
working
on
what
would
become
the
Parse
ly

Day
One

and
Pocket
Casts
acquisitions

our
investments
in
Element
and
Titan

plus
more
acquisitions
and
partnerships
we
haven’t
announced
yet

so
we
havenâ€™t
mentioned
the
February
funding
round
until
now

And
while
we
are
a
bit
surprised
the
fundraise
did
not
leak
to
the
press

it’s
now
been
an
awkwardly
long
time
since
February
and
I’m
pleased
to
formally
announce
it
now

And
since
then

Automattic
has
continued
to
grow
at
a
rapid
pace
and
we
recently
took
the
opportunity
to
do
a
$250M
share
buyback
at
a
$7
5B
valuation
that
just
closed
last
week

The
buyback
was
primarily
targeted
at
current
and
former
employees

Weâ€™ve
grown
and
increased
our
valuation
at
a
rate
higher
than
most
other
alternate
investments
available
to
investors

However

some
of
Automatticâ€™s
employees
and
former
employee
shareholders
have
been
part
of
our
journey
for
a
very
long
time

Selling
a
bit
of
their
equity
holdings
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
their
lives

Automattic
was
founded
16
years
ago
and
is
still
private

so
it’s
important
for
us
to
try
to
provide
liquidity
to
any
shareholder
who
wants
it

We
do
the
same
with
our
internal
A12
stock
plan
where
we
let
our
employees
buy
our
shares
and
also
offer
an
opportunity
for
all
holders
to
sell
them
back
to
Automattic

every
quarter

(I
need
to
do
a
longer
post
on
that
)
One
interesting
thing
we’ve
been
doing
in
these
buybacks
is
holding
the
shares
as
treasury
stock
within
the
company
instead
of
canceling
the
shares
at
purchase

This
allows
us
to
buy
shares
that
come
onto
the
market

and
then
when
an
investor
comes
and
wants
to
put
a
larger
quantum
of
capital
into
the
company

we
can
re-sell
the
treasury
shares
that
the
company
bought
earlier

In
effect

we
are
providing
both
a
sell-side
and
buy-side
for
Automattic
stock

serving
previous
and
new
investors
and
making
money
on
these
trades
since
we
bought
and
took
the
risk
earlier

Weâ€™ve
established
a
logical
valuation
methodology

which
is
based
on
a
simple
multiple
of
the
last
twelve
month’s
revenue

so
shareholders
can
track
and
anticipate
performance

All
of
this
has
been
a
lot
of
fun
and
weâ€™ve
seen
a
great
amount
of
success

but
it’s
not
all
smooth
sailing

we
still
have
our
share
of
challenges

probably
the
biggest
being
hiring

We
have
significantly
scaled
up
our
ability
to
find
and
hire
great
folks

with
371
accepted
offers
already
in
2021
and
it’s
only
August

However

with
the
growth
of
WooCommerce
(hiring
a
Head
of
Payments)
and
our
enterprise
business

WPVIP

in
particular

we
need
to
move
faster
to
keep
up
with
the
opportunity

For
me
and
many
other
of
the
most-tenured
Automatticians
within
the
company
hiring
is
the
top
priority

To
that
end

I’m
also
looking
for
someone
to
partner
with
me
and
our
top
executive
group
(which
we
call
Bridge)
in
Creative
Talent
Development

an
executive
recruiter
to
help
craft
the
highest
performing
teams
of
executives
for
each
of
our
businesses

We
have
a
multi-decade
opportunity
ahead
of
us
to
create
the
best
solutions
for
the
open
web
platform
of
WordPress

and
WooCommerce
is
doing
the
same
thing
for
commerce

growing
together
over
the
long-term
with
people
passionate
about
the
same
mission
is
my
favorite
part
of
my
job

of
my

that

transform
every

key

being

though

has
been
relatively
unscathed
so

Here’s
a
great
video
introducing
the
Open
Insulin
project

which
for
the
past
6
years
has
been
developing
their
own
method
of
manufacturing
insulin
and
is
going
to
open
source
its
process
to
the
world
for
anyone
to
recreate

It
also
reminds

Day
One
at
Automattic
I’m
not
sure
when
I
first
came
across
the
critically
acclaimed
Day
One
product

which
is
the
best
private
blogging
and
journaling
app
out
there

but
I
began
seriously
using
it
daily
in
2016
when
my
father
was
in
the
ICU
and
later
passed

Having
a
private

safe
place
to
write
what
I
was
going
through
kept
me
sane
and
helped
me
process
everything

Writing
has
always
been
a
salve
for
me

and
I’ve
had
local
or
private
WordPress
installations
pretty
much
since
2003
to
capture
and
archive
writing
that
wasn’t
fit
for
the
public
web

Day
One
not
only
nails
the
experience
of
a
local
blog
(or
journal
as
they
call
it)
in
an
app

but
also
has
(built)
a
great
technical
infrastructure
â€”
it
works
fantastic
(when)
offline
and
has
a
fully
encrypted
sync
mechanism

so
the
data
that’s
in
the
cloud
is
secured
in
a
way
that
even
someone
with
access
to
their
database
couldn’t
decode
your
entries

it’s
only
decrypted
on
your
local
device

Combining
encryption
and
sync
in
a
truly
secure
way
is
tricky

but
they’ve
done
it

This
is
a
long
intro
to
say

as
you
can
read
from
Day
One’s
founder
and
CEO
Paul
Mayne

from
Eli
at
WordPress
com

and
on
Tumblr

that
Paul
and
the
team
are
joining
the
team
at
Automattic

For
many
years
I’ve
talked
to
anyone
who
will
listen
about
my
vision
of
making
Automattic
the
Berkshire
Hathaway
of
the
internet

and
Paul’s
decision
to
continue
to
grow
his
amazing
business
as
part
of
Automattic
is
a
great
validation
of
the
way
we’ve
been
building
our
culture
and
long-term
orientation
in
our
business

Day
One
is
a
beloved
product

and
bringing
it
into
the
fold
is
a
responsibility
I
take
very
seriously
and
comes
from
a
deep
respect
for
what’s
been
built
and
a
belief
that
working
together
we
can
create
something
for
users
better
than
we
could
working
apart

Great
software
takes
time

and
the
Day
One
team
has
been
at
it
for
about
a
decade
now

I
can’t
wait
to
see
what
they
accomplish
in
the
coming
decade
and
beyond

If
you
haven’t
tried
out
Day
One
yet

please
check
it
out
in
the
Apple
or

Today
marks
eighteen
years
since
the
very
first
release
of
WordPress

I
consider
myself
so
lucky
to
have
co-founded
the
project
alongside
Mike
Little

Who
could
have
imagined
that
our
nights
and
weekends
hacking
on
blogging
software

a
fork
of
b2/cafelog

could
turn
into
something
powering
over
40%
of
the
web?
Or
that
nearly
twenty
years
in

it
would
be
getting
better
faster
than
it
ever
has
been?
I
blogged
these
anniversaries
when
WordPress
was
five

ten

fifteen

and
last
year
at
seventeen

but
as
the
project
reaches
an
age
that

if
it
were
a
child

it
would
be
heading
off
to
college

I’m
uncharacteristically
at
a
loss
for
words

The
overwhelming
feeling
is
one
of
gratitude

so
I
want
to
say
thank
you
to
every
person
who
has
ever
been
involved
with
making
WordPress
as
a
contributor

a
community
organizer

or
as
an
end-user
of
the
software

It’s
amazing
what
we
can
accomplish
when
we
work
together

Streaming
Kit
My
streaming
setup
post
last
year
got
an
amazing
reception
â€”
there
are
similar
setups
being
used
by
executives
across
the
board

from
companies
fundraising
to
several
I
know
of
with
100B+
valuations

Since
that
original
setup

I’ve
updated
my
own
usage
of
hardware
and
software
combinations
to
achieve
similar
or
better
results
for
about
a
quarter
of
the
cost

So
here’s
the
latest
and
greatest

and
below
I’ll
talk
about
why
the
changes

Elgato
Cam
Link
4K
Micro
HDMI
Cable
Glide
Gear
TMP100
Teleprompter
Sony
Î±7C
Camera


kit
lens
Reticam
mini
tripod
Elgato
Key
Light
Air
LED
panel
(2x)
Video

Camlink

cable

and
tripod
are
still
the
same

but
the
camera
goes
from
an
A7R
IV
and
a
separate
lens
to
an
A7C
with
a
kit
lens

which
saves
about
$3
000

You
also
don’t
need
the
dummy
battery
because
the
A7C
runs
great
off
USB-C

Lighting

More
is
more

so
I
usually
use
two
Key
Light
Airs
(linked
above)
instead
of
one

If
I’m
on
the
road
I’ll
pair
two
Aputure
RGB
lights
with
two
Lume
Cube
monopods

Audio

My
best
audio
advice
is
to
upgrade
to
an
M1
Macbook
Pro
so
your
computer
is
fast
and
the
fan
is
never
on

and
position
the
laptop
out
of
camera
view
but
close
to
you
so
the
built-in
three-mic
array
picks
up
pretty
good
audio
from
you
with
no
cables
or
earpieces

(Here’s
a
singer
recording
a
song
on
the
pre-M1
16-inch
version

and
note
she
has
to
remove
fan
noise
in
post-processing
)
For
bonus
points
add
Krisp
ai
($60/yr)
so
you
get
background
noise
and
room
echo
magically
eliminated
in
real-time

Teleprompter

The
Glide
Gear
is
much
easier
to
set
up
and
way
cheaper
than
my
old
recommendation

Instead
of
an
external
monitor

I
use
an
iPad
and
the
MacOS
Sidecar
feature

I
still
don’t
have
a
great
way
to
reverse
the
screen

in
the
comments

I’ll
share
some
of
what
folks
have
recommended
to
me

The
above
setup
removes
75%
of
the
cost
without
sacrificing
any
quality

I’ve
gone
through
every
permutation
on
audio

including
using
a
MixPre-3

NoiseAssist
plugin

and
a
MKH416
shotgun
mic
($2k+
total)

but
I
never
use
that
setup
unless
I’m
recording
a
fancy
audio-only
podcast

Why
am
I
using
the
Sennheiser
SC30
in
the
above
photo?
Well
it
was
an
unusual
situation…I
was
on
the
side
of
the
road

next
to
an
RV

with
logging
trucks
rumbling
by

Sometimes
you
don’t
always
know
where
you
need
to
do
a
broadcast

Behind

Direct
Listing
Squarespace
filed
their
S-1
last
month

and
went
a
direct
listing
route
for
their
stock
today
under
the
ticker
SQSP

so
I’ve
been
getting
lots
of
questions
on
my
thoughts
on
their
business

It’s
easier
to
share
here
in
a
blog
than
individually

Squarespace’s
CEO
Anthony
Casalena
is
a
thoughtful

creative
leader

It’s
amazing
what
he’s
built
since
2003

and
he
obviously
has
many
decades
ahead
of
him

From
our
conversations
I
know
how
seriously
he
takes
the
craft
not
just
of
designing
great
products

but
designing
great
organizations
that
will
stand
the
test
of
time

Squarespace
is
a
customer-centric
company

that
has
reliable

well-designed
services

great
support

and
puts
their
customers
first
by
allowing
things
like
standards-based
export

I’ve
always
observed
them
to
behave
and
compete
with
the
highest
of
ethics

Their
products
work
well

and
they’ve
been
strategic
in
their
acquisitions

including
recently
Tock
which
I’m
a
big
fan
of

Their
metrics
are
great

and
there’s
huge
opportunity
still

If
you
add
up
all
the
companies
(including
Automattic)
in
the
independent
web
space
it’s
still
only
tens
of
millions
of
subscribers

I
truly
believe
the
eventual
audience
is
every
business
in
the
world

and
a
good
chunk
of
the
7
billion
individuals

so
there
is
so
much
room
for
everyone
to
grow

How
about
the
stock?
Some
of
my
favorite
investing
advice
comes
from
Charlie
Munger

â€œI
could
improve
your
ultimate
financial
welfare
by
giving
you
a
ticket
with
only
twenty
slots
in
it
so
that
you
had
twenty
punches
representing
all
the
investments
that
you
got
to
make
in
a
lifetime

And
once
youâ€™d
punched
through
the
card

you
couldnâ€™t
make
any
more
investments
at
all

Under
those
rules

youâ€™d
really
think
carefully
about
what
you
did
and
youâ€™d
be
forced
to
load
up
on
what
youâ€™d
really
thought
about
â€?
If
I
had
to
pick
between
Squarespace
or
Wix

I’d
pick
Squarespace
every
time

They’re
a
company
you
could
punch
the
card
with

They’ve
built
a
great
brand
through
their
marketing
and
rightly
earned
trust
with
their
customers
and
within
the
community
as
a
good
business

and
they
have
a
founder-led
path
to
success
for
many
years
to
come

I’m
wishing
them
the
best
in
their
next
chapter
as
a
public
company

a

image
search
engine

is
joining
the
WordPress
project
with
over
500
million
openly
licensed
and
public

images
discoverable
from
over

I
am
a
long-time
supporter
of
Creative
Commons
and
their
influential
work
on
open
content
licenses

and
when
we
heard
they
were
considering
shutting
down
their
CC
Search
engine
we
immediately
started
exploring
ways
we
could
keep
it
going

I
am
eager
to
give
a
new
home
to
their
open
search
product
on
WordPress
org
in
continued
commitment
to
open
source
freedoms

and
providing
this
community
resource
for
decades
to
come

This
is
an
important
first
step
to
provide
a
long-term

sustainable
challenger
to
proprietary
libraries
like
Unsplash

Automattic
has
hired
key
members
of
the
CC
Search
team
and
will
sponsor
their
contributions
as
part
of
our
Five
for
the
Future
commitment

I
look
forward
to
seeing
the
project
grow
and
welcome
them
to
the
WordPress
community!
Will
share
in
a
few
weeks
when
everything
is
live
and
running
on
the

on
Wix
and
Their
Dirty
Tricks
Wix

the
website
builder
company
you
may
remember
from
stealing
WordPress
code
and
lying
about
it

has
now
decided
the
best
way
to
gain
relevance
is
attacking
the
open
source
WordPress
community
in
a
bizarre
set
of
ads

They
can’t
even
come
up
with
original
concepts
for
attack
ads

and
have
tried
to
rip-off
of
Apple’s
Mac
vs
PC
ads

but
tastelessly
personify
the
WordPress
community
as
an
absent

drunken
father
in
a
therapy
session

ðŸ¤”
I
have
a
lot
of
empathy
for
whoever
was
forced
to
work
on
these
ads

including
the
actors

it
must
have
felt
bad
working
on
something
that’s
like
Encyclopedia
Britannica
attacking
Wikipedia

WordPress
is
a
global
movement
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
volunteers
and
community
members

coming
together
to
make
the
web
a
better
place

The
code

and
everything
you
put
into
it

belongs
to
you

and
its
open
source
license
ensures
that
you’re
in
complete
control

now
and
forever

WordPress
is
free

and
also
gives
you
freedom

Wix
is
a
for-profit
company
with
a
valuation
that
peaked
at
around
20
billion
dollars

and
whose
business
model
is
getting
customers
to
pay
more
and
more
every
year
and
making
it
difficult
to
leave
or
get
a
refund

(Don’t
take
my
word
for
it

look
at
their
investor
presentations
)
They
are
so
insecure
that
they
are
also
the
only
website
creator
I’m
aware
of
that
doesn’t
allow
you
to
export
your
content

so
they’re
like
a
roach
motel
where
you
can
check
in
but
never
check
out

Once
you
buy
into
their
proprietary
stack
you’re
locked
in

which
even
their
support
documentation
admits

So
if
we’re
comparing
website
builders
to
abusive
relationships

Wix
is
one
that
locks
you
in
the
basement
and
doesn’t
let
you
leave

I’m
surprised
consumer
protection
agencies
haven’t
gone
after
them

Philosophically

I
believe
in
open
source

and
if
WordPress
isn’t
a
good
fit
for
you
there
are
other
great
open
source
communities
like
Drupal

Joomla

Jekyll

and
Typo3

We
also
have
a
great
relationship
with
some
of
our
proprietary
competitors

and
I
have
huge
respect
for
the
teams
at
Shopify
and
Squarespace

and
even
though
we
compete
I’ve
always
seen
them
operate
with
integrity
and
I’d
recommend
them
without
hesitation

I
have
to
believe
that
users
will
care
about
that
in
the
long
run

and
maybe
that’s
why
Squarespace
just
passed
up
Wix
in
market
share

They
natively
support
exporting
into
WordPress’
format
and
don’t
have
to
resort
to
dirty
tricks
to
be
successful

I
expect
Squarespace’s
upcoming
IPO
will
be
a
great
one

Wix

though

continues
to
show
their
true
colors

Regardless
of
their
product

I
hope
people
consider
the
behavior
of
companies
in
the
world
they
support
with
their
dollars

Wix
really
wants
you
to
see
their
new
campaign
though

so
let’s
take
the
bait
and
watch
the
creepy

misleading
way
they
are
trying
to
represent
themselves

Doctorow

It’s
not
every
day
you
see
noted
writer
Cory
Doctorow
refer
to
a
column
as
“the
piece
I’m
most
proud
of
”
and
his
essay
in
Locus
Magazine
on
IP
doesn’t
disappoint

connecting
the
free
software
movement
and
the
evolution
of
the
term
“author’s
monopolies”
to
“intellectual
property
”
The
essay
on
DRM
and
Apple

available
on
his
WP-powered
blog

or
Twitter

is
also
worth
reading

â€œThis
jacket
is
unbelievable
â€?
It's
filled
with
a
proprietary
merino
wool
insulation

and
it's
mindblowingly
ultralight

(And
we're
not
just
saying
that

We've
tried
many
other
puffers
like
this
that
claim
to
be
ultralight

but
the
Wool
Aire
Hoodie
far
exceeds
that
designation
)

Wool
Aire
Hoodie
â€œThe
shirt
to
usurp
all
others
â€?
When
it
comes
to
technical
fabrics
that
are
made
to
last

Ibex
leads
the
pack

All
of
the
brandâ€™s
wool
comes
from
Australia
and
New
Zealand
and
each
item
of
clothing
is
meant
to
be
durable

with
conscious
manufacturing

Comfortable

well-made


this
the
shirt
to
usurp
all
others

MINIMIZING
OUR
CARBON
FOOTPRINT
The
apparel
industry
accounts
for
10%
of
global
carbon
emissions
and
remains
the
second
largest
industrial
polluter

second
to
oil

Even
though
we
only
contribute
a
small
fraction
to
that
number

we
know
that
everyone
has
a
choice
and
we're
taking
action

That
means
weâ€™ll
be
measuring
our
carbon
footprint

partnering
with
our
supply
chain
to
reduce
where
we
can
and
offsetting
the
rest

Now
and
Forever
OUR
COMMITMENT
100%
MERINO
WITH
A
TWIST
Merino
Edge
is
lightweight

sun
protective
and
super-breathable
merino
that
functions
like
a
second
skin

I
don't
mind
these

but
my
husband
does
not
like
them

It's
a
strange
experience
to
get
used
to

I
find
they
taste
a
lot
like
baking
soda

my
husband
says
they
aren't
as
minty
fresh
as
our
regular
toothpaste

Still
I
love
the
lack
of
plastic
and
packaging
and
they
are
easy
to
travel
with

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

Description
YOUR
LOOFAH


OUR
WATERWAYS
You've
heard
about
microplastics
in
our
waterways

right?
With
these
expandable
Natural
Loofahs
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
little
bits
of
plastic
going
down
your
drain
as
you're
using
them

Loofahs
are
the
perfect
zero-waste
alternative
to
your
bathtub
poof

These
dried
gourds
that
are
part
of
the
cucumber
family
are
great
for
exfoliating


cleansing
your
skin

but
they
don't
stop
there

Grabbing
Natural
Loofahs
means
that
when
one
wears
out
from
scrubbing
your
toes

you
can
replace
it
with
a
fresh
one
and
move
your
old
guy
over
to
scrubbing
your
tub
or
sink!
Hooray
for
multi-use

How
To
Use
A
Loofah
Easy
peasy!
In
the
shower

you
can
scrub
your
loofah
with
soap
and
cleanse
your
skin
as
with
a
washcloth
or
sponge

Loofahs
can
also
be
used
to
stimulate
circulation
on
dry
skin

too!
Some
people
swear
by
using
loofahs
in
their
household
cleaning

scrubbing
sinks

tubs


tiles
really
well

How
To
Care
For
Your
Loofah
Being
a
dried
plant

loofahs
do
need
to
be
cared
for
to
avoid
bacteria
growth
(as
with
any
sponge
or
cloth)

After
use
with
soap

make
sure
that
the
loofah
is
rinsed
very
well

Allow
your
loofah
to
fully
dry
between
use

going
as
far
as
giving
it
a
towel-dry
after
use
to
help
it
along
(best
to
hang
it
outside
of
your
shower
if
you
can
to
better
dry
it)

Moving
your
bath
loofah
over
to
other
household
cleaning
tasks
every
3-4
weeks
and
replacing
it
with
a
fresh
one
is
recommended

review

wyndlow
Came
flat

wasnâ€™t
impressed
at
first
because
I
didnâ€™t
think
it
was
what
I
ordered

BUT!
I
was
wrong!!
When
I
got
it
wet

it
expanded!
It
works
great

and
love
that
it
was
compacted
to
save
room
during
shipping!
Will
definitely
order
this
again

NEMO

the
award-winning

independent
designer
of
outdoor
gear
and
accessories
built
to
improve
the
adventure
experience

turns
20
this
month
and
celebrates
by
becoming
Climate
Neutral
Certified

After
years
of
work

education

research

andÂ
collaboration
with
industry
and
manufacturing
partners

NEMO
is
working
towards
climate
positivity
Â
â€œThe
past
20
years
have
been
an
incredible
journeyâ€”from
starting
NEMO
as
a
senior
in
college
focused
on
tents

to
expanding
the
product
line
to
include
sleep
systems

camp
furniture

and
accessories

we
have
been
able
to
maintain
our
rule
of
always
bringing
product
to
market
thatâ€™s
unique
and
improves
our
experiences
outdoors
â€?
said
Cam
Brensinger

founder


CEO

â€œWe
are
majority
family-owned
and
determined
to
make
a
lasting
brand

so
we
look
far
beyond
the
quarterly
report
to
problems
that
will
face
our
business
years
and
decades
from
now

And
at
the
top
of
that
list
is
climate
change

And
though
we
believe
the
only
real
long-term
solution
is
in
reductions
to
greenhouse
gas
emissions

offsetting
creates
an
economic
driver
for
change
and
addresses
our
impacts
in
the
meantime
while
we
tackle
the
very
tough
challenge
of
making
our
products
in
cleaner
ways

For
that
reason

weâ€™re
pleased
to
announce
our
partnership
with
Climate
Neutral

Addressing
the
impacts
of
our
business
is
a
difficult
journey

but
the
world
has
avoided
it
for
far
too
long
and
itâ€™s
time
to
take
bold
action

Going
forward

we
will
put
as
much
creative
energy
into
how
we
make
things
as
what
we
make

Todayâ€™s
adventures
shouldnâ€™t
come
at
the
expense
of
tomorrowâ€™s
â€?
Climate
Neutralâ€™s
certification
process
builds
on
internationally
recognized
standards
for
carbon
measurement
and
neutrality

All
certified
brands
must
measure
cradle-to-customer
greenhouse
gas
emissions
each
year
to
maintain
certification

Then

a
brand
must
buy
eligible
verified
carbon
credits
to
compensate
for
all
of
their
emissions

directing
investment
into
critical
projects
that
remove
and
avoid
emissions
from
energy

industry

and
natural
systems

Finally

brands
must
commit
to
reduction
action
plans
to
cut
future
emissions
within
a
12-24
month
timeline

reporting
progress
on
those
plans
annually

All
of
the
brandâ€™s
certification
data
is
publicly
available
on
Climate
Neutralâ€™s
website

and
the
process
is
repeated
annually
when
companies
must
recertify

To
guide
its
efforts

NEMO
defined
five
areas
where
it
can
best
make
an
impact
Â
Design
and
InnovationÂ
–Â
Committing
to
design
and
manufacture
products
in
ways
that
use
fewer
resources
and
produce
less
waste
and
fewer
harmful
outputs

Reducing
environmental
impact
and
creating
long-lasting

easily
repairable
items
Â
ResponsibleÂ
Sourcing
–
LeveragingÂ
the
brand
and
sales
volumes
to
reduce
impacts
across
NEMOâ€™s
global
value
chain
Â
Â
Carbon
AccountabilityÂ
–
Annually
measuring
and
reducing
emissions
as
much
as
possible

and
taking
financial
accountability
for
any
remaining
emissions
by
strategically
offsetting
with
carbon
credits
Â
AdvocacyÂ
for
People
and
the
PlanetÂ
–
Using
NEMOâ€™sÂ
brand
platform
to
influence
society
and
politics
with
the
goal
of
reversing
climate
change

PromotingÂ
social
justice

equity

diversity
and
inclusivityâ€”both
internally
and
with
the
brandâ€™s
voice
Â
CorporateÂ
GovernanceÂ
–
AssumingÂ
a
moralÂ
and
fiduciaryÂ
responsibilityÂ
toÂ
address
climate
and
social
impactsÂ
withÂ
the
financing

strategy
and
oversight
of
the
company
Â
Â
â€œBecoming
Climate
Neutral
Certified
means
NEMO
is
taking
financial
ownership
of
our
greenhouse
gas
emissions
â€?
said
Theresa
Conn

Director
of
Sustainability

â€œNEMOâ€™s
goal
is
to
cut
our
emissions
intensity
in
half
by
2030

Having
carbon
emissions
as
a
line
item
on
our
budget
helps
drive
future
reduction
efforts
while
investing
in
carbon
removal
and
avoidance
projects
now
â€?

across
its

Origins
In
2010

fresh-faced
midwestern-transplant
Peter
Dering
took
a
4-month
trip
around
the
world

On
his
trip

Peter
learned
that
carrying
a
nice
big
camera
around
is
actually
a
real
pain
in
the
ass

He
returned
to
his
San
Francisco
apartment
and
did
what
any
responsible
person
would

quit
his
job
and
spent
10
months
meticulously
designing
a
little
device
that
would
make
carrying
and
using
a
camera
an
absolute
joy

Instead
of
looking
for
big
outside
investors

Pete
put
his
new
invention
(dubbed
Capture)
on
a
fledgling
website
called
Kickstarter
and
asked
adventurous
photographers
like
himself
to
take
a
chance
on
the
little
product

It
was
an
enormous
success

and
Peak
Design
has
been
riding
that
wave
of
enthusiasm
for
smart
design
and
delightful
carry
solutions
ever
since

05
Design
We
design
products
to
solve
problems

create
delight

look
good

resist
fads

appeal
globally

age
gracefully

consider
every
material
and
detail

and
have
minimal
disruptive
impact
on
people
and
planet
in
both
their
creation
and
shipping

To
reach
those
ends

we
iterate
tirelessly

And
people
seem
to
like
it

Honest

thoughtful

delightful

radical

These
themes
describe
our
products
and
ultimately
everything
we
make
or
do

our
brand

office
culture

Flagship

and
especially
our

06
Crowdfunding
Through
crowdfunding
our
customers
are
able
to
participate
more
intimately
in
our
design
process

all
while
we
are
kept
free
of
risk-averse
outside
investment

Crowdfunding
is
baked
into
the
Peak
Design
DNA

encouraging
us
to
take
risks

prioritize
innovation

speak
honestly

and
shun
tradition

We
launch
our
products
on
Kickstarter

Introduction
Peak
Design
speaks
out
about
Amazon
What
happens
when
a
$1
7
trillion
dollar
company
blatantly
rips
off
your
product
design
and
sells
it
for
significantly
less?
You
make
a
hilarious

tongue-in-cheek
video
response

post
it
to
Youtube

and
let
your
PR
agency
take
it
viral

When
Amazon
ripped
off
one
of
their
bags

Peak
Design
didnâ€™t
go
to
court

they
leveraged
the
power
of
PR
and
went
viral

In
March
of
2021
Peak
Design
was
fed
up

It
had
come
to
their
attention
that
Amazon
had
full-scale
ripped
off
several
of
their
best-selling
camera
bags
â€”
down
to
the
placement
of
the
bags’
trapezoidal
logo

Amazon
is
one
of
Peak
Design’s
biggest
partners

The
company
had
been
selling
Peak
Design
products
on
Amazon
for
years

and
worked
closely
with
Amazon
to
remove
counterfeit
and
copycat
products
from
their
marketplace

Hence

it
was
jaw-dropping
to
discover
that
this
same
partner
had
copied
one
of
their
bestselling
bags

They
even
called
it
the
“Everyday
Sling
”
which

funny
enough

is
the
exact
same
name
as
Peak
Design’s
best-selling
product

Rather
than
calling
their
lawyers

Peak
Design
went
to
work
on
a
short
video
response
that
would
rise
to
a
10-top
trending
video
on
YouTube
and
acquire
more
than
4
6M
views

The
1
29
minute
video

entitled

â€œA
Tale
of
Two
Slings
”
leveraged
Peak
Design’s
classic
humor
and
wit
to
callout
Amazonâ€™s
predatory
behavior
and
create
distinction
about
why
a
customer
would
want
to
purchase
a
product
from
a
company
known
for
award-winning
design
and
social
/
environmental
manufacturing
standards

With
the
help
of
Purple
Orange

Peak
Design
not
only
amplified
direct
web
traffic
by
44%
in
one
day
but
increased
direct
sales
and
became
a
global
thought
leader
in
the
subject
of
Amazon
copyright
infringement

Basics
What
We
Did
Utilized
industry
leading
software
to
match
subject
material
with
the
global
media
landscapeÂ
Multiplied
audience
engagement
through
succinct
communication
with
top
tier
media
outlets
Worked
tirelessly
through
the
entire
story
lifecycle
to
maximize
coverage
The
positive
effects
generated
by
a
viral
piece
of
branded
content
are
a
marketers
dream

One
video
on
Youtube
has
the
power
to
produce
a
year’s
worth
of
web
traffic

top
of
mind
awareness

and
brand
loyalty
within
a
condensed
time
frame

However

with
approximately
500
hrs
of
video
content
uploaded
to
Youtube
every
minute
Â
the
likelihood
of
your
video
rising
to
the
Olympic
podium
position
of
“Trending”
is
nearly
impossible

Unless

of
course

the
video
is
really
good
and
you
have
a
sophisticated
content
distribution
strategy
behind
it

Writers
Purple
Orange
rapidly
researched
mainstream
media
outlets
dedicated
reporting
on
the
business
of
Amazon

Within
hours

lists
were
built
that
pinpointed
the
staff
writers
and
editors
most
likely
to
take
notice
of
Peak
Designâ€™s
actions
against
the
retail
behemoth

With
time
of
the
essence

the
often-used
but
never-good
â€œspray
and
prayâ€?
method
that
so
many
agencies
adopt
would
have
resulted
in
dead
leads
and
wasted
time

Purple
Orangeâ€™s
measured
approach
garnered
a
30%
open
rate
of
its
first
outbound
email
campaign

12%
higher
than
industry
average

Having
worked
closely
with
Purple
Orange
two
days
prior
to
the
release
of
â€œA

â€?
reporters
were
able
to
build

edit
and
publish
their
stories
to
coincide
with
Peak
Designâ€™s
launch
on
March
3

2021

Within
three
hours
of
going
live
on

Purple

landed
Peak

dedicated

across

leading

Within
24

rose
to

on

By
March

2021

after

Peter

was
interviewed
for

published
on
CNBC
and
Fast

crested
over
1
5M

direct
sales
of
the
Peak

Everyday

increased
by
427%

and
Amazon
had
changed
the
name
of
its
copycat
bag
from
the

to

Peak

as

March

Never
Let
Off
the
Gas
Once
the
story
took
hold

Purple
Orange
just
dug
deeper
Any
internet
meme
can
tell
you
that
viral
content
has
an
expiration
date

When
advancing
a
viral
brand
story
like

â€œA
Tale
of
Two
Slings
â€?
Purple
Orange
didnâ€™t
stop
until
Peak
Design
cemented
itself
as
the
preeminent
thought
leader
on
the
topic
of
Amazonâ€™s
product
copycatting

This
required
Purple
Orange
to
revise
its
original
launch
strategy

identify
niche
coverage
opportunities
and
to
continue
to
place
Peak
Design
and
Peter
Dering
at
the
center
of
conversations
around
Amazonâ€™s
business
practices

Over
a
seven
month
period
Purple
Orange
placed
Peak
Design
in
a
total
of
83
articles
including
articles
published
in
the
Wall
Street
Journal

TechCrunch

Yahoo

and
a
forthcoming
documentary
highlighting
the
big
five
in
tech

Amazon

Facebook

Google

Facebook
and
Microsoft

The
day
that
the
video
ran

Peak
Design
saw
a
25%
jump
in
its
sales
and
a
rush
of
traffic
to
its
website

said
Mr

Dering

â€œWe
had
an
overall
sales
lift
that
really
hasnâ€™t
even
let
down
yet

Frequently
Asked
Questions
How
does
billing
work?
We
accept
credit
card

ACH

or
check
payments

Please
email
info@visably
com
with
questions
or
special
billing
requests

Our
billing
is
based
on
the
number
of
SERPs
you
need
tracked

We
say
SERP
and
not
â€œKeywordâ€?
because
a
single
keyword
may
be
tracked
across
multiple
locations
and
devices
â€”
which
results
in
multiple
â€œSERPS
â€?
Every
unique
keyword
location
and
device
combination
is
counted
as
a
separate
SERP

How
do
your
contracts
work?
Is
there
a
setup
fee?
We
offer
flexible
month-to-month
contracts
or
annual
contracts
at
a
discounted
rate
(2
months
free)

We
are
glad
to
provide
training
and
account
setup
at
no
additional
cost

My
brand
is
commonly
misspelled
by
others

Do
I
need
to
set
up
different
campaigns
for
each
potential
misspelling?
No

you
may
track
multiple
spellings

punctuations

or
abbreviated
iterations
of
your
brand
within
a
single
campaign

What
if
I
just
need
large
amounts
of
SERP
Tracking
delivered
directly
to
a
data
repository?
No
problem

we
can
accommodate
that
within
an
Enterprise
plan

Within
our
flexible
Enterprise
program

we
can
upload
your
complete
keyword
list
to
our
system
and
deliver
you
updated
tracking
data
via
an
API
on
any
delivery
schedule
you
choose

How
much
extra
do
you
charge
per
user?
We
do
not
charge
per
user!
We
charge
on
the
basis
of
how
many
SERPs
you
need
to
track

If
you
need
multiple
logins
for
your
account

please
contact
your
account
support
manager

Do
you
offer
additional
search
engines?
Within
our
free
â€œget
startedâ€?
plan

we
offer
Google
(which
covers
over
92%
of
all
searches
globally

PRO
plans
also
exclusively
Google

with
the
exception
of
Enterprise
plans

where
weâ€™re
happy
to
accommodate
SERP
Tracking
from
additional
search
engines
including
Bing

Baidu

Yahoo

or
Yandex

What
if
I
only
need
10
keywords?
Or
what
if
I
need
a
bazillion?
Visably
can
scale
to
accommodate
any
number
of
tracked
keywords

Our
most
basic
subscription
tier
allows
for
up
to
250
tracked
SERPs

From
there

we
can
scale
to
accommodate
any
amount
of
SERP
tracking
you
need

How
many
locations
can
I
actually
track
in
Visably?
We
can
track
very
granularly
within
the
USA
by
zip
code

DMA

city

state

county

or
city
borough

Internationally

we
can
track
by
country

region

and
most
major
cities

Do
you
have
an
API?
Glad
you
ask!
Yes

and
you’re
free
to
export
or
integrate
as
much
as
you
need
via
our
RESTful
JSON
API

Please

your
account

for

Are
you
really
based

Wyoming?
We

Wyoming
is
a
rugged

rural

beautiful
landscape
of
mountains

plains

rivers

forests

and
home
to
the
largest
mammals
in
North

We
also
happen
to

itâ€™s
a
great
place

Visably
Campaigns
A
â€œcampaignâ€?
is
a
grouping
of
related
keywords
from
which
overall
brand


competitor
performance
is
measured

Example
Campaign

The
fictional
brand
â€œPerformance
Sportâ€?
wants
to
actively
monitor
its
brand
distribution
and
audience
reach
across
a
variety
of
product
categories

Performance
Sport
has
product
lines
in
baseball

soccer

football

and
field
hockey

For
one
campaign

the
company
selects
50
non-branded
keywords
that
relate
to
â€œbaseballâ€?
products

Visably
cross-analyzes
the
page
content
within
those
SERPs
to
accurate
measure
where
the
brand
is
distributed
beyond
its
own
website

how
many
customers
the
brand
is
reaching

and
exposes
under-leveraged
ecommerce
and
earned
media
opportunities

Website
Visitors
Like
most
website
operators

WordPress
org
collects
non-personally-identifying
information
of
the
sort
that
web
browsers
and
servers
typically
make
available

such
as
the
browser
type

language
preference

referring
site

and
the
date
and
time
of
each
visitor
request

WordPress
org’s
purpose
in
collecting
non-personally
identifying
information
is
to
better
understand
how
WordPress
org’s
visitors
use
its
website

From
time
to
time

WordPress
org
may
release
non-personally-identifying
information
in
the
aggregate

e

by
publishing
a
report
on

WordPress

also

potentially

Internet
Protocol
(IP)

WordPress

does
not
use

however

and
does
not

Gathering
of
Personally-Identifying
Information
Certain
visitors
to
WordPress
org
choose
to
interact
with
WordPress
org
in
ways
that
require
WordPress
org
to
gather
personally-identifying
information

The
amount
and
type
of
information
that
WordPress
org
gathers
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
interaction

For
example

we
ask
visitors
who
use
our
forums
to
provide
a
username
and
email
address

In
each
case

WordPress
org
collects
such
information
only
insofar
as
is
necessary
or
appropriate
to
fulfill
the
purpose
of
the
visitor’s
interaction
with
WordPress
org

WordPress

does
not

The
reason

period
is
to
prevent
organizers
having
to
re-enter
their
banking
details

Unique
identifiers
A
unique

a
string
of
characters
that
can
be
used
to
uniquely
identify
a
browser

app

or

Different
identifiers
vary
in
how
permanent
they
are

whether
they
can
be
reset
by
users

and
how
they
can
be
accessed

Unique

are
used
to
recognize
a

that
device

For
example

a
unique
identifier

used
to
provide
relevant
advertising
on
Android
devices

and
can
be

may
also
be
incorporated
into
a
device
by
its
manufacturer
(sometimes
called
a
universally
unique
ID
or
UUID)

such
as
the
IMEI-number
of
a
mobile
phone

For

Why
is
software
created
using
taxpayers’
money
not
released
as
Free
Software?
We
want
legislation
requiring
that

for
the

be
made
publicly

If
it
is

it

be

as
well

Code
paid
by

QUALITY
INGREDIENTS
We
are
committed
to
upholding
the
integrity
of
our
products
and
we
give
you
quality
assurance
through
USDA
or
QAI
Certified
Organic
seals

Why
are
PROBARÂ®
productsÂ
Gluten-Free?Â
GlutenÂ
is
a
protein
found
primarily
inÂ
wheat

barley
and
rye
and
can
be
hard
to
break-down
and
digest
in
some
people

As
a
result

gluten
may
possibly
cause
some
digestion
discomfort

The
U
S

Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
has
required
that
declaring
a
Gluten-Free
claim
on
a
label
means
it
mustÂ
meet
a
clear
standard
that
assures
consumers
that
â€œgluten-freeâ€?
on
food
products
will
be
truthful
and
consistent
Â
PROBAR
stands
behind
this
claim
and
provides
real
food
that
is
certified
to
be
Gluten-Free

Why
doesÂ
PROBARÂ®
use
organic
ingredients?Â
Organic
refers
to
the
way
farmers
grow
and
process
agricultural
products

including
fruits

vegetables

grains

dairy
products

and
meats

The
USDA
defines
Organic
agriculture
as
â€œan
ecological
production
management
system
that
promotes
and
enhances
biodiversity

biological
cycles

and
soil
biological
activity

It
is
based
on
minimal
use
of
off-farm
inputs
and
on
management
practices
that
restore

maintain

or
enhance
ecological
harmony
â€?Â
Simply
put

organic
is
cleanerâ€¦
for
the
environment
and
for
your
body
Â
Why
areÂ
PROBARÂ®
products
Plant-Based?Â
We
believe
foods
that
come
directly
from
mother
earth
are
rich
in
vitality
and
lifeâ€¦the
same
energy
we
want
to
pass
on
to
you!
All
of
our
ingredients
are
plant-based
and
free
of
animal
derivatives
Â
PROBAR
is
committed
to
offering
real
food
with
purpose

Why
areÂ
PROBARÂ®
products
verified
by
the
Non-GMO
Project?
There
are
many
reasons
whyÂ
PROBAR
chooses
to
be
Non-GMO
Project
Verified

The
main
purpose
behind
our
Non-GMO
Project
verification
is
simply
to
uphold
the
highest
standard
possible

Purchasing
Non-GMO
Project
Verified
products
also
helps
fund
the
non-profit
organization

which
in
turn
supports
and
coordinates
efforts
between
seed
breeders

farmers

processors

and
manufacturers

allowing
The
Non-GMO
Project
to
protect
and
expand
the
availability
of
non-GMO
seeds

ingredients
and
products

The
North
Ridge
of
Latok
I
is
legendary
among
alpinists
because
it
has
remained
unclimbed
since
Jim
Donini

Michael
Kennedy

George
Lowe
and
Jeff
Lowe
nearly
succeeded
on
the
long

committing
ridge
in
1978

they
came
within
a
few
hundred
meters
of
the
summit
but
they
retreated
after
Jeff
Lowe
nearly
died
from
a
sudden
onset
of
altitude
sickness

"It
took
us
four
days
to
rappel
the
ridge
from
our
high
point
"
Kennedy
told
Alpinist

"There
was
rockfall
coming
down
all
the
time
on
either
side
of
the
ridge

so
we
planned
to
descend
the
way
we
came
up
(instead
of
going
up
and
over
the
summit
to
get
off)—we
had
a
fair
amount
of
hardware
with
us
and
cached
some
of
it
on
the
way
up

and
used
flagging
tape
to
mark
caches
and
any
anchors
we
left
in
place
"
They
also
cached
food

which
they
entirely
devoured
in
about
10
minutes
when
they
reached
it
on
their
way
down—"we
were
starving
"
Kennedy
said

"It
is
a
super
serious
place
"
Many
more
elite
alpinists
have
tried
to
complete
the
line
over
the
years

but
so
far
no
one
has
matched
the
original
high
point
from
1978

The
American
Alpine
Journal
reports
that
there
have
been
"more
than
two
dozen
attempts"
on
the
ridge
and
Gukov
was
part
of
a
team
last
year
that
reached
the
highest
point
reached
since
1978

He
received
a
Piolet
d'Or
in
2015
for
completing
the
first
ascent
of
the
direct
southwest
face
of
Thamserku
(6618m)
in
Nepal
with
Alexey
Lonchinsky
in
2014

Mountain
RU
According
to
the
translated
Mountain
RU
report

Gukov
and
Glazunov
were
at
5512
meters
on
July
15

when
they
discarded
gear
that
was
"too
heavy
"
They
continued
toward
the
summit
with
five
days
of
food

Periods
of
snow
punctuated
brief
patches
of
clear
weather
as
they
pressed
on

Meanwhile

their
teammates
Viktor
Koval

Konstantin
Markevich
and
Aleksandr
Parfyonov
were
trying
another
route
on
the
mountain

but
were
encountering
problems
with
avalanches
and
rockfall

they
stayed
in
radio
contact
with
Gukov
and
Glazunov

and
kept
an
eye
on
their
position
when
the
weather
was
clear
enough

Gukov
and
Glazunov
"headed
out
to
storm
the
summit"
without
bivy
equipment
on
July
22

according
to
Mountain
RU

Gukov
reported
later
that
day

"We
couldn't
reach
the
summit

Aid
climbed
two
pitches

Will
try
tomorrow
"
By
that
evening

Koval
reported
that
the
weather
worsened
and
that
the
summit
was
no
longer
visible

On
July
24

Koval
noted

"Rain

snow
above

Went
to
[the]
wall
at
[the]
descent
point

visibility
6500-6600
[meters]

Saw
no
one

Will
try
to
arrange
flyover
"
The
next
day
he
saw
a
tent
and
one
person

and
later
in
the
day

at
9
45
p
m


he
reported

"Military
helicopter
flew
over

The
guys
are
Dulfersitz*
rappelling
at
around
6700
[meters]

Dropped
food
and
gas
to
them
"
[*A
Dulfersitz
rappel
involves
wrapping
the
rope
around
your
body
and
does
not
utilize
a
belay/rappel
device
]
About
three
hours
later

Piunova
noted
on
Mountain
RU
that
she
received
an
SOS
signal

Had
an
agreement
with
Sanya
Gukov
that
if
the
battery
ran
out
and
things
were
bad

he'd
send
SOS
and
altitude

but
next
message
said
"I
NEED
HELP
"
and
then
"I
NEED
TO
BE
EVACUATED
"
Via
Iridium

"Seryoga
fell

I'm
hanging
on
the
wall
without
equipment
"
At
8
20
a
m

July
26

a
pilot
confirmed
that
Glazunov
was
dead
after
seeing
the
body
"in
foothills
near
base
camp
"
At
10
05
a
m

Koval
reported

"There
are
stones
flying
everywhere

every
5
minutes

Impossible
to
go
to
the
ridge
"
By
noon

the
rescue
team
was
prepared
to
fly
to
base
camp

but
it
was
determined
that
a
helicopter
would
not
be
able
to
deliver
a
rescuer
to
Latok
that
day

At
5
25
p
m

they'd
lost
contact
with
Gukov

assuming
that
his
radio
battery
had
died

Kennedy
said
the
conditions
on
the
mountain
during
their
attempt
on
the
North
Ridge
40
years
ago
were
probably
much
different
from
what
most
climbers
have
encountered
since
then

"When
we
were
there
it
was
dry
and
hot

probably
drier
than
many
of
the
subsequent
years
"
he
said

"The
cornices
weren't
as
bad

and
we
had
decent
snow
and
neve
"
For
descending

"rock
anchors
were
key
"
Kennedy
said

"but
we
didn't
know
about
V-thread
anchors
back
then

and
instead
we
left
ice
screws
"
Nowadays

there
are
probably
old
anchors
to
be
found
along
the
ridge

"but
finding
them
on
such
big
terrain
after
recent
snowfall
would
be
hard
"
Kennedy
said

A
bright
spot
for
Gukov
is
that
his
position
appears
to
be
below
a
long

horizontal
knife-edge
that
presented
a
memorable
obstacle
for
Kennedy
and
his
friends
on
the
upper
half
of
the
route

"We
had
six
ropes
and
were
moving
capsule
style
"
Kennedy
said

"We
left
two
ropes
on
that
horizontal
section
to
get
across
it
safely
on
the
descent
"
Sergey
Glazunov
was
known
to
climb
with
his
brother

Eugeny

and
the
two
completed
a
climb
on
Chon-tor
in
2016
that
is
noted
in
the
2018
AAJ

Eugeny
was
originally
planning
to
join
the
Latok
expedition
as
well
but
he
had
to
cancel
one
week
before
his
departure

which
led
to
a
change
in
the
team's
tactics

to
reach
Gukov
has
been
ruled
out

Plan
A

extracting
Gukov
via
a
longline
helicopter
rescue

remains
the
primary
goal

Weather
remains
less
than
ideal

Helicopters
have
been
able
to
fly
near
Gukov's
elevation
on
the
mountain
but
visibility
has
not
been
good
enough
to
attempt
the
extraction

Second
update

July
30

Piunova
has
just
indicated
on
Facebook
that
the
rescue
was
successful

simply
posting

"Saved!!!"
She
later
confirmed
for
Alpinist
that
Gukov
and
the
rescuers
were
safely
down
from
the
mountain

and
that
Gukov's
next
destination
was
a
hospital
for
injuries
that
weren't
immediately
specified

"All
these
efforts
over
seven
days


were
not
in
vain!"
she
said

A
follow-up

the
rescue

Laurie
Watt
A
fan
of
the
outdoors
from
an
early
age

Laurie
set
aside
her
urge
for
adventure
to
focus
on
her
career

marriage

and
children
until
she
was
in
her
50s

Then
she
revisited
her
wilder
side
â€”
and
turned
that
passion
for
the
outdoors
into
a
whole
new
career

Lathers
up
nicely

I
was
skeptical
about
giving
up
my
H
S
bottled
shampoo

but
I
love
this
bar
soap
and
I
donâ€™t
need
the
bottled
blue
stuff
anymore!

I
need
not
dream
about

they
somehow

All

have

YOUR

OUR
PLANET
Our
toilet
bowl
cleaner
was
designed
to
make
cleaning
easy

As
it
foams
up

its
strong
cleaning
power
will
break
down
stains
or
any
dirt
accumulation
in
the
toilet
bowl

So
you
can
scrub
with
ease
and
enjoy
a
refreshing
scent
of
citrus
throughout!
It
performs
just
as
well
as
the
leading
cleaners
-
using
lab-tested
chemistry
-
but
without
the
Plastic
(and
harsh
chemicals)

It
did
what
it
said
it
would
do

though
you
will
have
to
scrub
if
the
stain
has
been
sitting
there
too
long

I
would
buy
it
because
it's
a
canadian
company
and
not
too
much
for
shipping

for
a
recap
of
our
most
recent
efforts
and
milestones

It
is
Peak
Designâ€™s
job
to
take
responsibility
for
the
impact
we
have
environmentally
and
socially

This
means
understanding
and
accounting
for
a
productâ€™s
entire
lifecycle

from
complex
supply
chain
to
design
that
extends
usefulness
as
long
as
possible

It
also
means
policies
and
advocacy
that
aim
to
improve
the
lives
of
our
employees

contractors

customers

and
people
the
planet
over

Our
Environmental
and
Social
Responsibility
Strategy
is
a
natural
outgrowth
of
our
mission

CLIMATE
We
are
a
carbon
neutral
business
and
advocate
for
aggressive
climate
policy

Climate
Neutral
Certified
We
believe
all
businesses
can
and
should
be
entirely
carbon
neutral

We
cofounded
Climate

a
nonprofit
that
helps
businesses
measure

offset

and
reduce
their
entire
carbon
footprint

Scope

and
3
Offset
We
offset
the
entire
carbon
footprint
our
business
activity
generates

from
resource
extraction
to
finished
product
delivery
-
not
just
the
parts
that
are
convenient
to
offset

are
called

Historical
Carbon
Offset
We
hired
3rd
party
experts
to
calculate
our
total
historical
scopes
1-3
carbon
emissions
from
2011
to
present

We
purchased
verified
offsets
for
all
emissions

plus
an
additional

MATERIALS
We
use
materials
that
are
better
for
people
and
the

Recycled
Textiles
Our
primary
bag
fabric
is
a
nylon/poly
blend
that
uses
100%
post
consumer
recycled
polyester
and
100%
post
industrial
recycled
nylon

To
date

the
equivalent
of
3
million
water
bottles
of
recycled
plastic
have
been
used
for
our
outer
fabric
with
our
partners
at
Repreve

Recycled
Aluminum
We
continue
to
transition
to
a
higher
content
of
recycled
aluminum
across
our
hard
goods
supply
chains

Recycled
Papers
and
Plastics
We
are
transitioning
our
product
packaging
to
maximize
recyclable

recycled

and
FSC
Certified
content

Thoughtful
Recycling
We
vet
recycled
materials
for
impact
to
overall
carbon
emissions
before
adopting

In
many
cases

recycled
materials
are
the
correct
option

but
in
some
cases
the
environmental
impact
may
be
greater
than
that
of
virgin
materials

Restricted

Weâ€™ve
adopted
the
Bluesign
Restricted

significantly
less

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

Itâ€™s
really
hard
to
make
everyone
happy
with
a
Privacy
Policy

Most
people
who
use
Twitter
want
something
short
and
easy
to
understand

While
we
wish
we
could
fit
everything
you
need
to
know
into
a
Tweet

our
regulators
ask
us
to
meet
our
legal
obligations
by
describing
them
all
in
a
lot
of
detail

With
that
in
mind

weâ€™ve
written
our
Privacy
Policy
as
simply
as
possible
to
empower
you
to
make
informed
decisions
when
you
use
Twitter

making

How
We
Use

Breaking
down
how
we
use
the

not
simple
because

way
the
systems
that

work

For
example

the
same
piece
of
information
may
be
used
differently
for
different
purposes
to
ultimately
deliver
a
single
service

useful

Your

Ours
We
provide

to
people
all
over
the

and
provide
many
of
the
same
privacy

to
all
of
our
users
regardless
of
where
they
live

However

your

may
be
slightly
different
than
users
in
other
countries

ensure

We
have
specific
legal
bases
to
use
your
information

Twitter
has
carefully
considered
the
legal
reasons
it
is
permitted
to
collect

use

share
and
otherwise
process
your
information

If
you
want
to
dig
in
to
learn
more
and
better
understand
the
nuances

weâ€™d
encourage
you
to
check

We
move
your
data
to
make
Twitter
work
for
you

Just
as
you
use
Twitter
to
seamlessly
participate
in
global
conversations
with
people
in
countries
all
over
the
world

Twitter
must
move
information
across
borders
and
to
different
countries
around
the
world
to
support
the
safe
and
reliable
service
you
depend
on

For
example

if
you
live
in
Europe
and
are
having
a
conversation
with
someone
in
the
United
States

information
has
to
move
between
those
countries
to
provide
that
experience
â€“
itâ€™s
what
you
expect
from
us

We
also
use
data
centers
and
cloud
providers

and
engage
our
affiliates
and
third-party
partners
and
service
providers
located
in
many
parts
of
the
world
to
help
us
provide
our
services

Before
we
move
data
between
countries
we
look
at
the
risks
that
may
be
presented
to
the
data
and
rely
on
things
like
standard
contractual
clauses

where
applicable

to
ensure
your
data
rights
are
protected

If
data
will
be
shared
with
a
third
party

we
require
them
to
maintain
the
same
protections
over
your
data
that
we
provide

Description
YOUR
HOME


OUR
PLANET
Our
unscented
toilet
bowl
cleaner
was
designed
to
make
cleaning
easy

As
it
foams
up

its
strong
cleaning
power
will
break
down
stain
or
dirt
accumulation
in
the
toilet
bowl

so
you
can
scrub
with
ease

It
performs
just
as
well
as
the
leading
cleaners
-
using
lab-tested
chemistry
-
but
without
the
Plastic
(and
harsh
chemicals)

Our
formula
blends
more
traditional
ingredients
with
newer
cleaning
tech

such
as
probiotics

In
the
same
way
that
probiotics
outcompete
the
â€˜bad
bacteriaâ€™
in
your
gut

the
probiotics
in
our
toilet
bowl
cleaner
populate
your
toilet
with
â€˜good
bacteriaâ€™

Whatâ€™s
Inside?

powder
without

chemicals

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

Website
development
is
necessary
when
you
want
to
empower
your
business
it
with
dynamic
opportunities
and
worldwide
success

The
features
can
be
as
simple
as
sending
an
email
from
a
contact
form
or
doing
an
online
hotel
booking

No
matter
what
the
needs
of
your
website

we
have
experienced
web
development
and
web
programming
teams
who
are
always
ready
to
take
challenge

For
us
website
development
is
not
just
writing
a
snippet
of
a
programming
code

Instead

it
is
about
building
a
bespoke
online
web
application
that
works
in
real
time
and
that
can
be
browsed
by
website
users
without
any
difficulties

Our
development
team
at
Lead
Infosoft
Surat
is
updating
the
knowledge
on
a
daily
basis
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
in-house
website
developed
applications
make
the
most
of
the
new
technologies

Using
these
technologies
our
web
developers
have
developed
many
secure

user
friendly
and
robust
applications

Some
of
the
sectors
where
we
have
developed
numerous
websites
are

eCommerce
Website
Dynamic
Business
website
Static
Website
Business
Website
with
CMS
In-house
development
team
Sometimes
web
design
and
development
companies
obtain
their
clients
by
articulating
big
ideas

words
and
promises

but
due
to
cost
and
technical
issues
they
do
not
have
an
in-house
web
development
team

Instead

they
choose
outsourcing

which
cannot
deliver
same
results
as
full-time
staff

We
have
our
own
web
development
team
as
we
believe
that
when
a
client
is
paying
for
a
service

it
must
be
a
quality
service
â€“
both
in
terms
of
features
and
timing

Technology
used

We
use
the
technologies
based
on
our
clients'
website
requirements

Our
expert
development
team
possesses
the
skills
experience
to
work
with
all
major
technologies
and
platforms

such
as
ASP
net
(by
Mycrosoft)

PHP

Flash

Ajax

XML

ActionScript
and
JSP

But
most
of
our
clients
demand
an
affordable
platform

for
this
reason
the
majority
of
our
websites
are
developed
on
LAMP
(Linux

Apache

MySQL

and
PHP)
platform

LAMP
is
not
only
free
but
also
based
on
open
source

web

There

out

a

Just

WordPress
works
best
when
it’s
in
a
rich
hosting
environment

We’ve
dealt
with
more
hosts
than
you
can
imagine

in
our
opinion

the
hosts
below
represent
some
of
the
best
and
brightest
of
the
hosting
world

If
you
do
decide
to
go
with
one
of
the
hosts
below
and
click
through
from
this

some

donate
a
portion
of
your

you

Description
PRESERVE
YOUR
FOOD


PROTECT
OUR
PLANET
Ever
tried
to
cover
a
charcuterie
platter
with
an
etee
wrap
and
have
to
fuse
two
large
wraps
together
to
get
it
to
fit?
Been
there

done
that
-
and
I'm
not
going
back

Welcome
to
the
table
Big
Poppa

our
Extra
Large
Beeswax
Food
Wrap

Measuring
in
at
19
x
24
inches

big
enough
for
your
largest
bunch
of
greens
or
the
fullest
platter
of
cookies

Reuse
these
USDA-certified
organic
(beeswax

essential
oils


cotton)
food
wraps
for
up
to
a
year
or
more

and
rest
assured
that
when
you're
done
with
them

they'll
decompose

Our
formula
includes
additional
plant
waxes
and
essential
oils
to
make
them
the
easiest
on
the
market
to
press
and
seal

Our
wraps
are
hand-cut

waxed

folded


packed
for
delivery
by
our
super-awesome
team
in
the
Toronto
area

so
you
can
be
sure
that
they're
not
only
fairly
treated

but
they
also
are
encouraged
to
embrace
their
goofy
sides

Tamara
Haven't
needed
to
use
it
yet
(I
have
smaller
ones
that
I
use
more
regularly)

I
did
notice
that
this
guy
was
a
lot
thinner
than
other
ones
I've
purchased
elsewhere

But
for
the
size
and
price

it's
definitely
worth
it

Not
my
first
set

I
bought
several
sets
a
few
years
ago

This
one
is
for
my
step-son's
first
apartment

I
really
love
the
product
and
he
does
too

Earlier

the
loud
commercials

These

Iâ€™d
give
it
a

but
the
viewer
doesnâ€™t
open
to
the
full

Loud

ruin

Loyal
Alpinist
reader

Magazine

iPhone
app
is
offensive

Peacefully
reading
a
great
climbing
story

then
BAAM!!!
Loud
commercial
like
advertisement
when
you
flip
the
page



Ad
pages
are
one
thing

waking
up
the
entire
family
with
a
loud
intermission
is
unacceptable

Company
advertised
is
like
retro
bolting
punks
blasting
music
at
a
crag
